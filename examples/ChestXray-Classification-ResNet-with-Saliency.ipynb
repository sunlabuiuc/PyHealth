    "\n",
    "**Gradient Saliency Maps:**\n",
    "- ✓ Fast - single backward pass through gradients\n",
    "- ✓ Works with any differentiable model  \n",
    "- ✓ Good for identifying \"where\" the model looks\n",
    "- ✓ Straightforward implementation\n",
    "- ✓ **Fully supports all architectures including ResNet**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Can be noisy and may require smoothing\n",
    "- ⚠️ Doesn't satisfy conservation property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP):**\n",
    "- ✓ **Conservation property**: Relevances sum to model output for the target class\n",
    "- ✓ More theoretically grounded attribution\n",
    "- ✓ Modular design with layer-specific handlers\n",
    "- ✓ Better captures \"how much\" each pixel contributes\n",
    "- ✓ Supports both CNNs and MLPs with UnifiedLRP\n",
    "- ✓ **Experimental ResNet support** with skip connection handlers\n",
    "- ⚠️ Requires layer-specific propagation rules\n",
    "- ⚠️ Expected conservation violations of 5-150% depending on rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which one to use?**\n",
    "- Use **Gradient Saliency** for quick exploration and fast prototyping\n",
    "- Use **LRP** when you need precise, quantifiable attributions with conservation\n",
    "- Use **LRP Epsilon Rule** for numerically stable, balanced attributions\n",
    "- Use **LRP Alpha-Beta Rule** for sharper visualizations emphasizing positive evidence\n",
    "- Use **both** to get complementary insights into your model's behavior!\n",
    "\n",
    "**UnifiedLRP Status:**\n",
    "- ✅ Production-ready for sequential CNNs (VGG, AlexNet)\n",
    "- ✅ Supports: Conv2d, MaxPool2d, BatchNorm2d, Linear, ReLU, Flatten, Dropout, AdaptiveAvgPool2d, AvgPool2d, Embedding\n",
    "- 🧪 **Experimental**: ResNet skip connections (AdditionHandler implemented, integration in progress)\n",
    "- ⏳ Future: Transformer attention, RNN support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on ResNet**: This notebook demonstrates experimental LRP support for ResNet architectures. The AdditionLRPHandler splits relevance proportionally between skip connection branches. Results should be interpreted with care as the implementation is under active development."

    "- **Good attributions**: High comprehensiveness (model breaks when important features removed)\n",

    "**Sufficiency (lower is better):**\n",
    "- Measures how much the prediction drops when we **KEEP ONLY** the most important features\n",
    "- If the attribution is sufficient, keeping only important features should preserve the prediction\n",
    "- Formula: `SUFF = P(original) - P(only_top_k_kept)`\n",
    "- **Good attributions**: Low sufficiency (model works well with only important features)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for Medical AI:**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensiveness Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Measures prediction drop when removing top-k most important features\n",
    "   - **Higher scores** = Better attributions (removing important features breaks the model)\n",
    "   - If all methods score low, the attributions may not identify truly important features\n",
    "   - Look for the method with highest comprehensiveness across all percentages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sufficiency Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Measures prediction drop when keeping ONLY top-k most important features\n",
    "   - **Lower scores** = Better attributions (model works with just important features)\n",
    "   - If scores are high, the attribution missed important information\n",
    "   - Look for the method with lowest sufficiency, especially at higher percentages\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combined Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Ideal method**: High comprehensiveness + Low sufficiency\n",
    "   - This means: Important features are correctly identified (comprehensive) and sufficient for prediction\n",
    "   - Trade-offs: Some methods optimize for one metric over the other\n",

    "**For Medical AI:**\n",
    "- These metrics validate that our attributions are meaningful and not random noise\n",
    "- Higher faithfulness = More trustworthy explanations for clinicians\n",
    "- Helps select which interpretation method to use in production systems\n",
    "- Essential for regulatory approval and clinical deployment"
