    "\n",
    "- Goal: Reproduce core ideas of SHy (patient hypergraphs, message passing, temporal phenotypes) using PyHealth for data handling and a minimal PyTorch model.\n",
    "- Rules for this notebook:\n",
    "  - Run step-by-step. After each checkpoint, share outputs before proceeding.\n",
    "  - CPU by default. If you switch to GPU, ensure tensors/devices are consistent.\n",
    "  - Keep seeds fixed for reproducibility.\n",
    "  - We’ll start with synthetic MIMIC-III from PyHealth for quick iteration, then document how to swap to real MIMIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpoints:\n",
    "1) Environment + imports (local PyHealth)\n",
    "2) Load synthetic MIMIC-III diagnoses and sanity checks\n",
    "3) Prepare patient sequences, vocabulary, and splits\n",
    "4) Implement simplified SHy modules (message passing + phenotypes)\n",
    "5) Training loop and metrics (Recall@k, nDCG@k)\n",
    "6) Explanations: show phenotypes per patient\n"

    "### Background: What is SHy and why hypergraphs?\n",
    "- SHy (Self-Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks) models each patient as a hypergraph: nodes are diagnosis codes; hyperedges are visits that connect the codes recorded together. This captures higher-order (non-pairwise) disease co-occurrences that sequence-only models may miss.\n",
    "- The model learns patient-specific code embeddings via message passing on the patient’s hypergraph, then extracts K temporal phenotypes as concise, personalized explanations that drive the final prediction (a concept bottleneck).\n",
    "- Key advantages: (1) higher-order structure; (2) succinct, editable explanations; (3) robustness to missing codes by proposing plausible code–visit links before phenotype extraction.\n",
    "- Reference: Yu et al., “Self-Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks for Diagnosis Prediction” (AAAI 2024). Code: https://github.com/ThunderbornSakana/SHy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of the pipeline in this notebook\n",
    "1) Build per-patient sequences of visits and a code vocabulary (ICD-9) using PyHealth’s `MIMIC3Dataset`.\n",
    "2) For each patient, create an incidence matrix `P ∈ {0,1}^{|C|×T}` (rows: codes; cols: visits): `P[i,j]=1` if code i appears in visit j.\n",
    "3) Learn code embeddings and apply UniGIN-like message passing: codes → visits (aggregate codes per visit), then visits → codes (aggregate visits per code) to get personalized code embeddings.\n",
    "4) Extract K temporal phenotypes via a differentiable binary mask over the (code, visit) grid using Gumbel-sigmoid; each phenotype selects a sub-hypergraph.\n",
    "5) For each phenotype, aggregate visit information with a GRU + location-based attention to obtain a phenotype embedding; combine K phenotype predictions via self-attention.\n",
    "6) Train with BCEWithLogits (multi-label next-visit codes); evaluate with Recall@k and nDCG@k; visualize explanations (α weights and top codes per phenotype).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is CPU-friendly for development (synthetic MIMIC-III). It also documents how to switch to real MIMIC when credentialed. See the paper for full details; this notebook stands alone for key ideas and a working reproduction scaffold.\n"

    "### Data & preprocessing (PyHealth)\n",
    "- We use PyHealth’s synthetic MIMIC-III endpoint for quick iteration. This avoids credentialing for real MIMIC and matches the `diagnoses_icd` schema used in the literature.\n",
    "- Patient API: `dataset.get_patient(pid)` → `patient.get_events('diagnoses_icd')` yields time-ordered diagnosis events with attributes like `hadm_id` (visit ID) and `icd9_code`.\n",
    "- We group events by `hadm_id` to form a sequence of visits per patient, each visit being an unordered set of ICD-9 codes.\n",
    "- We build a code vocabulary (ICD-9) and split patients 80/10/10 into train/val/test at the patient level to avoid leakage.\n",
    "- Incidence matrix `P` (codes × visits) is constructed from each patient’s history; the prediction target is the final visit’s multi-hot code vector.\n",
