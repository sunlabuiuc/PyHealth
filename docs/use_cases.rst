Use Cases of PyHealth
=====================

PyHealth enables various healthcare machine learning applications. Below are some practical use cases, categorized by data modality, each linked to an interactive Google Colab notebook.

Structured Data
===============

Predicting Hospital Readmission
-------------------------------
Hospital readmission prediction helps identify patients at high risk of returning to the hospital shortly after discharge. This can assist healthcare providers in taking preventive measures.
