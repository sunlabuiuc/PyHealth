pyhealth.interpret.methods.ShapExplainer
========================================

Overview
--------

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method computes feature attributions for PyHealth models
based on coalitional game theory. This helps identify which features (e.g., diagnosis codes, 
lab values) that most influenced a model's prediction.

For a complete working example, see:
``examples/shap_mortality_mimic4_stagenet.py``
