Tasks
===============

We support various real-world healthcare predictive tasks defined by **function calls**. The following example tasks are collected from top AI/Medical venues, such as: 

(i) Drug Recommendation [Yang et al. IJCAI 2021a, Yang et al. IJCAI 2021b, Shang et al. AAAI 2020]

(ii) Readmission Prediction [Choi et al. AAAI 2021]

(iii) Mortality Prediction [Choi et al. AAAI 2021]

(iv) Length of Stay Prediction

(v) Sleep Staging [Yang et al. ArXiv 2021]
