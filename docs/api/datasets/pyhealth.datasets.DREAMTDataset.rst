pyhealth.datasets.DREAMTDataset
===================================

The Dataset for Real-time sleep stage EstimAtion using Multisensor wearable Technology (DREAMT) includes wrist-based wearable and polysomnography (PSG) sleep data from 100 participants recruited from the Duke University Health System (DUHS) Sleep Disorder Lab. 

This includes wearable signals, PSG signals, sleep labels, and clinical data related to sleep health and disorders.

The DREAMTDataset class provides an interface for loading and working with the DREAMT dataset. It can process DREAMT data across versions into a well-structured dataset object providing support for modeling and analysis.

Refer to the `doc <https://physionet.org/content/dreamt/>`_ for more information about the dataset.
