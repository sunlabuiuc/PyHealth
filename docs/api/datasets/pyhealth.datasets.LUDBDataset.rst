pyhealth.datasets.LUDBDataset
===================================

The Lobachevsky University Electrocardiography Database (LUDB) includes 200 ECG recordings collected from 2017-2018. Each recording is 10 seconds long, sampled at 500 Hz, and contains 12 leads with manually annotated boundaries and peaks of P, T waves and QRS complexes independently annotated by cardiologists for each of the 12 leads. The dataset also includes diagnostic labels (rhythm type, electric axis, conduction abnormalities, hypertrophies, ischemia, etc.).

Refer to the `doc <https://physionet.org/content/ludb/1.0.1/>`_ for more information about the dataset.
