pyhealth.models.JambaEHR
=========================

Overview
--------

Hybrid Transformer-Mamba model for EHR clinical prediction, inspired by
Jamba (AI21 Labs, ICLR 2025). Interleaves self-attention and selective
SSM layers for each feature stream, combining attention's global context
with SSM's linear-time efficiency for long patient histories.
