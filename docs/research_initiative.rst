PyHealth Research Initiative
============================

Overview
--------

The PyHealth Research Initiative is an annual summer research program that brings together talented 
students to conduct cutting-edge research in healthcare artificial intelligence. Through this program, 
participants work on innovative projects that advance the field of computational healthcare, contributing 
to publications, open-source software, and the broader healthcare AI community.

The initiative provides students with hands-on experience in:

- **Healthcare AI Research**: Working on real-world healthcare problems using electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical data
- **Machine Learning Development**: Implementing and evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Contributing to the PyHealth library and ecosystem
- **Academic Publishing**: Co-authoring research papers and presenting findings
- **Collaborative Research**: Working alongside researchers and industry partners
