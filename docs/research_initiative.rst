PyHealth Research Initiative
============================

Overview
--------

The PyHealth Research Initiative is a year-round, open research program that brings together talented 
individuals from diverse backgrounds—including students, engineers, researchers, and healthcare professionals—to 
conduct cutting-edge research in healthcare artificial intelligence. This inclusive program welcomes anyone passionate 
about advancing computational healthcare, regardless of their career stage or institutional affiliation. Through this program, 
participants work on innovative projects that advance the field of computational healthcare, contributing 
to publications, open-source software, and the broader healthcare AI community.

The initiative provides participants with hands-on experience in:

- **Healthcare AI Research**: Working on real-world healthcare problems using electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical data
- **Machine Learning Development**: Implementing and evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Contributing to the PyHealth library and ecosystem
- **Academic Publishing**: Co-authoring research papers and presenting findings
- **Collaborative Research**: Working alongside researchers and industry partners
