PyHealth Research Initiative
============================

Overview
--------

The PyHealth Research Initiative is a year-round, open research program that brings together talented 
individuals from diverse backgrounds—including students, engineers, researchers, and healthcare professionals—to 
conduct cutting-edge research in healthcare artificial intelligence. This inclusive program welcomes anyone passionate 
about advancing computational healthcare, regardless of their career stage or institutional affiliation. Through this program, 
participants work on innovative projects that advance the field of computational healthcare, contributing 
to publications, open-source software, and the broader healthcare AI community.

The initiative provides participants with hands-on experience in:

- **Healthcare AI Research**: Working on real-world healthcare problems using electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical data
- **Machine Learning Development**: Implementing and evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Contributing to the PyHealth library and ecosystem
- **Academic Publishing**: Co-authoring research papers and presenting findings
- **Collaborative Research**: Working alongside researchers and industry partners

Mission & Goals
---------------

We're an open-source community of researchers with the goal of building:

1. **Easily accessible and reproducible research** — Making healthcare AI research transparent and replicable
2. **Solutions to real-world healthcare problems** — Tackling important clinical challenges with practical impact
3. **Connections with healthcare professionals** — Bridging the gap between AI researchers and clinical practitioners

We connect those who want to work on healthcare problems with industry and academic collaborators to create 
meaningful impact in healthcare AI.
