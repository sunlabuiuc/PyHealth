Welcome to PyHealth
====================================

**The Python Library for Healthcare AI**

Build, test, and deploy healthcare machine learning models with ease. PyHealth makes healthcare AI development accessible to researchers, data scientists, and medical practitioners.

**Key Features**

- Modular 5-stage pipeline for healthcare ML
- Healthcare-first: medical codes and clinical datasets (MIMIC, eICU, OMOP)
- 33+ pre-built models and production-ready trainer/metrics
- 10+ supported healthcare tasks and datasets
- Fast (3x faster than pandas) data processing for quick experimentation

PyHealth is designed for both **ML researchers and medical practitioners**. We can make your **healthcare AI applications** easier to develop, test and validate. Your development process becomes more flexible and more customizable. `[GitHub] <https://github.com/sunlabuiuc/PyHealth>`_ 



Get Started in Minutes
=============================

PyHealth makes healthcare AI development simple and powerful. Build production-ready models with just a few lines of code.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyhealth.datasets import MIMIC3Dataset
   from pyhealth.tasks import MortalityPredictionMIMIC3
   from pyhealth.models import RNN
   from pyhealth.trainer import Trainer

   # Load healthcare data
   dataset = MIMIC3Dataset(root="data/", tables=["diagnoses_icd", "procedures"])
   samples = dataset.set_task(MortalityPredictionMIMIC3())

   # Train model
   model = RNN(dataset=samples)
   trainer = Trainer(model=model)
   trainer.train(train_dataloader, val_dataloader, epochs=50)

**That's it!** You now have a trained healthcare AI model ready for deployment.
