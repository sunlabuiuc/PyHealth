PyHealth can support **diverse electronic health records (EHRs)** such as MIMIC and eICU and all OMOP-CDM based databases and provide **various advanced deep learning algorithms** for handling **important healthcare tasks** such as diagnosis-based drug recommendation, patient hospitalization and mortality prediction, and ICU length stay forecasting, etc.

*Build a healthcare AI pipeline can be as short as 10 lines of code in PyHealth*.


Modules
--------------------------

All healthcare tasks in our package follow a **five-stage pipeline**:

 load dataset -> define task function -> build ML/DL model -> model training -> inference

! We try hard to make sure each stage is as separate as possibe, so that people can customize their own pipeline by only using our data processing steps or the ML models. Each step will call one module and we introduce them using an example.

An ML Pipeline Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **STEP 1: <pyhealth.datasets>** provides a clean structure for the dataset, independent from the tasks. We support ``MIMIC-III``, ``MIMIC-IV`` and ``eICU``, as well as the standard ``OMOP-formatted data``. The dataset is stored in a unified ``Patient-Visit-Event`` structure.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.datasets import MIMIC3Dataset
    mimic3base = MIMIC3Dataset(
        root="https://storage.googleapis.com/pyhealth/Synthetic_MIMIC-III/",
        tables=["DIAGNOSES_ICD", "PROCEDURES_ICD", "PRESCRIPTIONS"],
        # map all NDC codes to ATC 3-rd level codes in these tables
        code_mapping={"NDC": ("ATC", {"target_kwargs": {"level": 3}})},
    )

User could also store their own dataset into our ``<pyhealth.datasets.SampleBaseDataset>`` structure and then follow the same pipeline below, see `Tutorial <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UurxwAAov1bL_5OO3gQJ4gAa_paeJwJp?usp=sharing>`_

* **STEP 2: <pyhealth.tasks>** inputs the ``<pyhealth.datasets>`` object and defines how to process each patient's data into a set of samples for the tasks. In the package, we provide several task examples, such as ``drug recommendation`` and ``length of stay prediction``.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.tasks import drug_recommendation_mimic3_fn
    from pyhealth.datasets import split_by_patient, get_dataloader

    mimic3sample = mimic3base.set_task(task_fn=drug_recommendation_mimic3_fn) # use default task
    train_ds, val_ds, test_ds = split_by_patient(mimic3sample, [0.8, 0.1, 0.1])

    # create dataloaders (torch.data.DataLoader)
    train_loader = get_dataloader(train_ds, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
    val_loader = get_dataloader(val_ds, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
    test_loader = get_dataloader(test_ds, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

* **STEP 3: <pyhealth.models>** provides the healthcare ML models using ``<pyhealth.models>``. This module also provides model layers, such as ``pyhealth.models.RETAINLayer`` for building customized ML architectures. Our model layers can used as easily as ``torch.nn.Linear``.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.models import Transformer

    model = Transformer(
        dataset=mimic3sample,
        feature_keys=["conditions", "procedures"],
        label_key="drugs",
        mode="multilabel",
    )

* **STEP 4: <pyhealth.trainer>** is the training manager with ``train_loader``, the ``val_loader``, ``val_metric``, and specify other arguemnts, such as epochs, optimizer, learning rate, etc. The trainer will automatically save the best model and output the path in the end.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.trainer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(model=model)
    trainer.train(
        train_dataloader=train_loader,
        val_dataloader=val_loader,
        epochs=50,
        monitor="pr_auc_samples",
    )

* **STEP 5: <pyhealth.metrics>** provides several **common evaluation metrics** (refer to `Doc <https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/metrics.html>`_ and see what are available) and **special metrics** in healthcare, such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) rate.

.. code-block:: python

    trainer.evaluate(test_loader)


Medical Code Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **<pyhealth.codemap>** provides two core functionalities: (i) looking up information for a given medical code (e.g., name, category, sub-concept); (ii) mapping codes across coding systems (e.g., ICD9CM to CCSCM). **This module can be independently applied to your research.**

* For code mapping between two coding systems

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.medcode import CrossMap

    codemap = CrossMap.load("ICD9CM", "CCSCM")
    codemap.map("82101") # use it like a dict

    codemap = CrossMap.load("NDC", "ATC")
    codemap.map("00527051210")

* For code ontology lookup within one system

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.medcode import InnerMap

    icd9cm = InnerMap.load("ICD9CM")
    icd9cm.lookup("428.0") # get detailed info
    icd9cm.get_ancestors("428.0") # get parents

Medical Code Tokenizer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **<pyhealth.tokenizer>** is used for transformations between string-based tokens and integer-based indices, based on the overall token space. We provide flexible functions to tokenize 1D, 2D and 3D lists. **This module can be independently applied to your research.**

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.tokenizer import Tokenizer

    # Example: we use a list of ATC3 code as the token
    token_space = ['A01A', 'A02A', 'A02B', 'A02X', 'A03A', 'A03B', 'A03C', 'A03D', \
            'A03F', 'A04A', 'A05A', 'A05B', 'A05C', 'A06A', 'A07A', 'A07B', 'A07C', \
            'A12B', 'A12C', 'A13A', 'A14A', 'A14B', 'A16A']
    tokenizer = Tokenizer(tokens=token_space, special_tokens=["<pad>", "<unk>"])

    # 2d encode
    tokens = [['A03C', 'A03D', 'A03E', 'A03F'], ['A04A', 'B035', 'C129']]
    indices = tokenizer.batch_encode_2d(tokens) # [[8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 1, 1, 0]]

    # 2d decode
    indices = [[8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 1, 1, 0]]
    tokens = tokenizer.batch_decode_2d(indices) # [['A03C', 'A03D', 'A03E', 'A03F'], ['A04A', '<unk>', '<unk>']]

..

Users can **customize their healthcare AI pipeline** as simply as calling one module

* process your OMOP data via ``pyhealth.datasets``
* process the open eICU (e.g., MIMIC) data via ``pyhealth.datasets``
* define your own task on existing databases via ``pyhealth.tasks``
* use existing healthcare models or build upon it (e.g., RETAIN) via ``pyhealth.models``.
* code map between for conditions and medicaitons via ``pyhealth.codemap``.

Benchmark on Healthcare Tasks
----------------------------------

* Here is our `benchmark doc <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4OwCSDaEt7vGmocidq1hK2HCTeB6ZHDzAZvlubpi08/edit#gid=2062485923>`_ on healthcare tasks. You can also check this below.

We also provide function for leaderboard generation, check it out in our `github repo <https://github.com/sunlabuiuc/PyHealth/tree/master/leaderboard>`_.

Here are the dynamic visualizations of the leaderboard. You can click the checkbox and easily compare
the performance for different models doing different tasks on different datasets!
