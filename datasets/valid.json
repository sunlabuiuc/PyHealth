No bowel obstruction in this patient status post gastric \nbypass surgery. \n4. Retained catheter in the right body wall extending into the \ncentral spinal canal for which clinical correlation is advised. \n\nCTA HEAD\/NECK ___\n1. Normal CTA of the head. \n2.

The \nstomach pouch was small. The GJ anastomosis was carefully \nexamined and appears intact, with no ulcers. (biopsy: normal)\nNormal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy: normal)\nOtherwise normal EGD to jejunum\n\nEUS ___\nLinear EUS was performed with the Olympus enchoendoscope at \n7.5mHz. A focused\/limited EUS evaluation was possible given the \ngastric bypass anatomy, which does not allow EUS visualization \nfrom the duodenal bulb (for critical distal biliary and \nampullary view). The PD was measured at 2.2mm in the body, and \n2.5mm in the head, which is normal diameter. The intrahepatic \nbiliary system was slightly dilated, and the extrahepatic \nCHD\/CBD was only mildly dilated (maximum diameter 7.8mm), within \nthe normal limits for post CCY state. The CBD cannot be traced \nto the ampulla because of the gastric bypass anatomy. No filling \ndefects or mass is seen.\nLimited eval with EUS scope notable for gastric bypass anatomy \n\nRecommendations: Will need careful review of prior CT scans from \n___ and ___. Biliary dilation is \nlikely benign\/post CCY. This can often be more prominent after \ngastric bypass ___ et al J. Gastro Surg ___. It is \nimportant to demonstrate stability over time. If prior scans \nshow no biliary dilation, then can consider single balloon to \nevaluate ampulla and further surveillance imaging to rule out \nmass. \n\nCOLONOSCOPY ___\nPolyp at 20cm in the distal sigmoid colon (polypectomy)\nNo bleeding seen.\nOtherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ yo woman s\/p Roux-en-Y ___ years ago with \nh\/o nutritional deficiencies, Behcet syndrome, hypothyroidism, \ndepression and chronic pain, who presented with nausea, \nvomiting, RUQ pain, and weight loss.\n\n# FAILURE TO THRIVE: Presented with ongoing weight loss and very \npoor ability to tolerate PO, reportedly eating only 2 6-oz \nyogurts daily. Failure to thrive was thought largely nutritional \nin setting of this very poor PO intake. However she is on \nsignificant opiate regimen which was thought to contribute as \nwell both from standpoint of GI motility and mental status. \nOpiates were downtitrated as below with some improvement.\n\n# NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Patient with chronic post-prandial \nnausea\/vomiting. Imaging was remarkable only for biliary \ndilatation (see below) with no evidence of obstruction or other \netiology of nausea\/vomiting. She underwent EGD to evaluate her \nanastomosis; this was normal. Nausea\/vomiting thought likely \nmultifactorial due in part to high dose opiate use and decreased \nGI motility, as well as inability to tolerate large volumes of \nfood s\/p Roux en Y. Opiates decreased, she was seen by \nnutrition, and was tolerating POs well prior to discharge. \nRecommend consideration of referral for bypass revision if \nnausea\/vomiting continues.\n\n# BILIARY DILATATION: Patient presented with intermittent \npostprandial RUQ pain and significant RUQ tenderness on exam. \nShe is s\/p remote cholecystectomy. CT identified significant \nbiliary dilatation which could not be further elucidated with \nMRCP given that patient has retained pain pump catheter in \nintrathecal space. RUQ ultrasound identified area concerning for \nperiampullary mass. EUS was done but did not visualize any such \nmass. Patient will follow up with her PCP and GI. COmparison \nwith prior imaging and consideration of repeat imaging to \ndetermine if any interval change is recommended.\n\n# NARCOTIC USE FOR CHRONIC PAIN: Patinet with long standing \nchronic pain of somewhat unclear etiology as well as high dose \nopioid use with recent dose increases correlating to time course \nof her FTT. Fentanyl patch was decreased from 100 to 75 mcg\/h. \nREcommend considering further decrease on discharge, as well as \npain clinic referral.\n\n# CONCERN FOR HORNER'S SYNDROME: Patient with left sided \nHorner's syndrome on exam, also with decline of mental status. \nWas seen by neurology who recommend CTA head\/neck and CT of \nupper chest. THese were unremarkable except for ___ cerebral \natrophy. Recommend outpatient follow up\/neuropsychiatric \ntesting. \n\n# S\/P ROUX EN Y: Continued B vitamin, MVI. Labs here revealed \nslightly low B2 and otherwise no deficiencies.\n\n# HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH normal  here. Continued home synthroid.\n\n# DEPRESSION: Somewhat poor mood without SI. Continued home \nfluoxetine, trazodone.\n\n# CODE:  FULL \n# CONTACT:  Partner ___ ___, daughter ___ ___\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[ ] Will need careful review of prior CT scans from ___ and ___. \n[ ] Biliary dilation is likely benign post Roux-en-Y changes. If \nprior scans show no biliary dilation, however, then can consider \nsingle balloon to evaluate ampulla and further surveillance \nimaging to rule out mass.\n[ ] Consider repeat CT in future to trend biliary \ndilatation\/rule out enlarging mass lesion.\n[ ] Fentanyl patch decreased to 75 mcg. Recommend considering \ndecreasing opioid regimen, possible pain clinic referral, to \nminimize opioid dosing given c\/f contribution to hypotension and \ndecreased motility.\n[ ] Consider neuropsychiatric testing as outpatient given e\/o \ncerebral atrophy on CT.\n[ ] Consider referral to surgery if patient still unable to \ntolerate po to consider reversal of Roux en Y.\n[ ] Please follow pending pathology on colonic polyp.\n[ ] Consider monitoring QTc as outpatient given ongoing use of \nZofran and mildly prolonged QTc here.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

With regards to the urinary symptoms, she was \nfound to have a UTI, and was started on antibiotics with \nimprovement, with plan for completion of 7-day course of \nciprofloxacin. With regards to the confusion concerning for \nhepatic encephalopathy, this was assessed and felt most likely \nto be precipitated by the urinary infection. Her mental status \ncleared with initiation of lactulose\/rifaximin, and she was \ndischarged with plan for continued lactulose therapy to reduce \nthe chance of future episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. With \nregards to the paracentesis site, it was no longer leaking upon \narrival to the floor. It was monitored closely and her abdomen \nwas assessed by ___ for tappable pocket given concern for \npossible SBP, with small pocket of straw-colored fluid obtained. \nThe fluid analyses showed evidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low \ntotal protein (0.9), and negative neutrophil criteria for SBP \n(PMNs 235), without any culture growth to date at the time of \ndischarge.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n============== \n#Decompensated EtOH cirrhosis c\/b volume refractory ascites \n#Concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis \nThe patient has a history of refractory ascites secondary to her \ncirrhosis which has historically required frequent LVP (~5L, \n___. When the patient reported to her outpatient \nhepatology office following her most recent paracentesis (___), \nshe reported ongoing leakage of yellow fluid from her \nparacentesis site necessitating ___ dressing changes\/day, \nwithout any ascites reaccumulation. Per patient, this has \nhappened once before with a prior paracentesis and self-resolved \nafter ___ days, nonetheless, her outpatient hepatologist Dr. \n___ was concerned that she might have an evolving complication \nat the site of the paracentesis and sent her to the emergency \nroom for further evaluation. By the time the patient arrived at \nthe ___ ED on ___, the drainage from the paracentesis site \nhad dramatically decreased; and by the time she reached the \nfloor on the morning of ___, the drainage had entirely stopped, \nwith only scant yellow drainage appreciable on the gauze \npadding. Despite the cessation in drainage and quiescent \nappearance of paracentesis site w\/o erythema or induration or \npurulence, given the potential for clinically silent SBP she \nunderwent ___ assessment for tappable pocket, during which 20 mL \nof straw-colored fluid were obtained. The fluid analyses showed \nevidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low total protein (0.9), and \nnegative neutrophil criteria for SBP (PMNs 235), negative gram \nstain, without any culture growth to date at the time of \ndischarge, and thus low concern for SBP at this point.\n\n#UTI:\nThe patient's UA on admission showed nitrites and rare bacteria, \nand subsequently grew out pan-sensitive E-coli. Despite absence \nof urinary symptoms (dysuria, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort, \nflank tenderness), given altered mental status and laboratory \nfindings was treated for presumed UTI, initially with CTX (___) \nwith subsequent transfer to ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID with plan \nto complete seven day course. \n\n___: \nThe patient was noted to have a Cr bump to 1.3 from admission \n(up from baseline 1, has been as high as 1.7 in past). She has \nknown b\/l renal cysts demonstrated on US imaging as recently as \n___. Her change in Cr this admission was felt to be most \nlikely pre-renal in the setting of volume depletion from the \nUTI. She did not meet criteria for further evaluation for HRS, \ngiven no evidence of ascites, and Cr <1.5. Her Cr remained \nstable at 1.2-1.3 during the admission; she was discharged with \nclose outpatient hepatology follow-up. \n\n#Hepatic Encephalopathy: \nPrior to this admission, the patient had no history of hepatic \nencephalopathy and reported regular BM ___ without \nlactulose. However, on days preceding this admission she became \nmore forgetful, and was noted to have b\/l asterixis on admission \nexam and to have confusion about day of the week, concerning for \nfirst-episode of hepatic encephalopathy, likely triggered by her \nurinary tract infection. She was evaluated with US and lab w\/u \nfor concomitant clot or bleed trigger, and this work-up was \nnegative. She was treated with lactulose\/rifaximin and her \nmental status cleared, with concomitant improvement in her \nasterixis. She was discharged on maintenance lactulose taken as \nneeded with titration for goal ___ BMs\/day, with plan for close \nhepatology follow-up. \n\n#Screening\/Maintenance \nThe patient's status with regards to screening and surveillance \nwas assessed as a component of routine inpatient cirrhosis care \nto ensure ongoing optimization. With regards to vaccination, she \nwas noted to have had both pneumococcal vaccines (completed \n___ influenza this year (___), HAV vaccination \n(___), and HBV immunity by serologies (___), with the \nmajority of this information documented in the ___ \nsystem. With regards to malignancy screenings, her last ___ \nscreening was ___, and showed coarsened hepatic echotexture \nwith nodular capsular contour, and no masses concerning for ___. \nWith regards to behaviors mediating her cirrhosis, she reported \nno current alcohol use, with last drink ___ months ago. \n\n#GERD:\n- The patient reported she had not been taking the omeprazole on \nher PAML recently due to issues with insurance coverage of \nomeprazole. She experienced some GERD symptoms during the \nadmission, predominantly burning in chest, w\/o frank sense of \nacid refluxing back to her throat or other symptoms, which she \nassociated temporally with the initiation of the \nlactulose\/rifaximin. She was treated symptomatically with \ncalcium carbonate for these symptoms and improved; we recommend \nthat she follow up with her primary care provider about \nalternate GERD medication if her symptoms continue to be \nbothersome, as detailed in transitional issues. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES \n============== \n#HLD: \n- The patient's home simvastatin was continued during the \nadmission without issue. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \n============== \n-NEW MEDICATIONS: The patient was started on one new long term \nmedication this admission, lactulose 30 mL PO\/NG TID with goal \nto titrate to ___ daily. She was also discharged on a seven \nday course of ciprofloxacin, which she is due to complete on \n___.\n\n-PRIMARY CARE: \n[] Follow-up on the patient's Cr at the next scheduled visit, as \nthis remained mildly elevated at 1.2 ___ 1.0) at the time of \ndischarge. She was discharged on her home diuretic regimen.\n[] We recommend further discussion of alternate medications for \nGERD management that might be covered by the patient's insurance \nat the next routine primary care appointment if the patient is \ncontinuing to report significant and ongoing GERD symptoms. \n[] We also recommend follow-up regarding to the patient's \nurinary symptoms, to ensure resolution after completion of the \nantibiotic course. \n\n-HEPATOLOGY: \n[] We recommend follow-up on the final peritoneal fluid \ncultures, which were pending at the time of discharge.\n[] Follow up ascites and need for repeat paracentesis and need \nfor long-term lactulose therapy.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The degree of MR seen has decreased. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with \nincreased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or \nelevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern \nfor pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme \nleak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent \ncardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, \nlactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary \nedema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who \ntransferred the patient to cardiology floor.\n\n# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation\/mitral regurgitation: \nLikely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in \nworsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior \nwall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac \ncath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically \nwith lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was \nconsulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair\/replacement. \nHowever, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high \nrisk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made \nto revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient \nwould regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a \nbare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in \nthe diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her \nmitral regurgitation. \n\n# NSTEMI\/CAD:\nAs evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was \nbriefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac \ncatheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed \n3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with \naspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As \nthe patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to \nthe cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will \nrequire plavix for at least 1 month.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued \nnifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. \nShe was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.\n\n# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. \n \n# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently \nat baseline. \n\n# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. \n\n# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be \nscheduled to follow up with the first available CMED \ncardiologist. \n* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal \nstent placement = ___.\n* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her \ninsurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10\/month).\n* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still \nhypertensive. \n* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ \nsecondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The patient \nunderwent breast U\/S of L sided breast lump which was negative. \nUPEP\/SPEP and kappa\/lambda from ___ were negative. \nCT abdomen and pelvis from ___ showed no evidence of \nmalignancy, and mediastinal lymph node biopsy from ___ showed no \nmalignant cells. Steroids were initially held due to concerns of \nallergic and infectious causes of hypereosinophilia. The patient \nreceived benadryl for treatment of pruritis.\n\n# Complex seizure disorder: The patient was on four AEDs at \nadmission: lamictal 150 2 pills BID, Keppra 500 two pills BID, \nphenobarbital 32.4 two pills BID, dilantin 100mg two pills BID. \nShe had been on these AEDs for many years prior to presentation. \nThere was some concern at ___ that one of these \nmedications may have been contributing to her eosinophilia. Her \nlamictal dose was reduced by 30% prior to transfer to ___. She \nwas initially maintained on the reduced dose of lamictal and on \nher home doses of her other AEDs in consultation with her \nprimary neurologist Dr. ___. She underwent patch testing of \nthese four AEDs, which showed did not show any signs of drug \nallergy to these medications, but the sensitivity of this test \nin general is low.\n\n#dCHF: EF 65% in ___. On admission chest xray, the patient \nhad evidence of pulmonary edema (___), which may have been \ncontributing to hypoxemia in addition to her baseline lung \ndisease. She underwent diuresis with her home PO lasix 40mg with \nadditional IV 40-60mg lasix throughout her admission with \ngradual improvement in her O2 requirement. At time of discharge, \nweight was 98.1 kg. Discharged on Lasix 40mg po BID (previously \n40mg po daily at home). Will f\/u w\/ ___ CHF service. Room air \nsat 92% at rest, and desatted to 85% w\/ ambulation but quickly \nrecovers. Discharged home w\/ O2 w\/ exertion.\n\n# COPD:  Patient was treated for a COPD exacerbation with \nantibiotics at ___ prior to transfer to ___. \nGiven positive strongyloides, she was not given steroids \nthroughout her hospitalization, and the pulmonology team felt \nthat she did not need steroid treatment. She was given albuterol \nnebulizers as needed for wheezing, though these did not produce \nimprovement in her O2 requirement. \n\n# HTN: The patient's blood pressure was elevated on presentation \nto ___, likely in the setting of her home BP agents \n(amlodipine, furosemide, olmesartan) being held at the outside \nhospital. She was restarted on her home amlodipine and given \nPO+IV furosemide as above. Her olmesartan was held due to \nhyperkalemia.  \n\n# Hyperkalemia: Patient had persistently elevated potassium \nthroughout admission (max ___. Her medications were reviewed \nwith pharmacy and were felt to not be contributing to her \nhyperkalemia. Given hyperkalemia and eosinophilia, she had AM \ncortisol testing to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency, which \nshowed cortisol >20 making this unlikely.\n\n# LLE radiculopathy: Patient had left leg shooting pain daily \nthroughout her admission, starting in the hip radiating down the \nleg. She had a normal neurologic exam during these episodes. She \nreported that this was a chronic problem previously diagnosed as \nsciatica, treated with tylenol at home. She was given tylenol \nand PRN oxycodone and tramadol for the pain with subsequent \nrelief in her symptoms.\n.\n##TRANSITIONAL ISSUES##\n- F\/u with PCP and check ___ (patient aware; creat 1.3 \n___\n- Patient is due for a screening mammogram and pap smear and \nshould have these scheduled after discharge\n- Please ensure pt is up to date on all age appropriate cancer \nscreens.\n- Pt due for 3rd dose of Ivermectin on ___\n- patient scheduled for multiple f\/u appointments as listed \nabove\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Your blood tests and biopsies from ___ ___ showed that you had high numbers of eosinophils, a type of blood cell, in your blood, skin, and lungs. To evaluate the cause of these findings, you were seen by the hematology, pulmonology, and allergy services, who reviewed your records and your prior imaging and recommended several lab tests. These teams were concerned that one of your anti-seizure medications was contributing to your symptoms. You underwent patch testing to see if you were allergic to those medications, which was negative. You had many tests sent looking for infections that can cause high number of eosinophils, which showed positive strongyloides, a type of worm that can come from dogs. You had studies looking at autoimmune and inflammatory causes of high eosinophils, which were negative. You also had blood tests to look for cancers in the blood that can cause high eosinophils, which were negative. You had a breast ultrasound, which did not show anything concerning in your breast. You had a chest xray that showed some extra fluid that may have been contributing to your low oxygen, so we gave you some extra lasix to remove some of the fluid, which led to a resolution of your oxygen requirement."}

CXR and CT abdomen did not \nreveal any free air. However, she was noted to have massive \ncolonic edema at the hepatic flexure.  This was thought to be \ndue to a microperforation after random biopsy from colonoscopy. \nThere was no anion gap, and her lactate was normal. She was made \nNPO, and she initially received aggressive pain management with \nIV diluadid. Stool studies were negative for infection, she was \nstarted on a 10 day course of Cipro\/Flagyl given likely \nmicroperforation of the colon.  Her diet was advanced slowly \nuntil she was able to tolerate a regular diet.  She was also \nstarted on loperamide for her diarrhea with improvement in her \nsymptoms.

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system \nrevealed \nno significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and \nRCA \nwere all normal without angiographically apparent flow limited \ndisease. \nThe LCx had a large ramus branch. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right \nsided \nfilling pressures with mean PCWP 29mmHg and RVEDP 15mmHg.  There \nwas \nsevere pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 69 mmHg. \nCentral aortic \npressures were normal at 137\/80 with a mean of 97 mmHg. \n3. The mean mitral valve gradient was 13.5 mmHg and calculated \nMVA 1.23 \ncm2 with excellent hemodynamic tracings, oxygen saturation \nconfirmed \nPCWP and reversed transducers.  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. \n2. Moderate mitral stenosis with valve area 1.23 cm2, mean \ntransmitral \npressure gradient 13.4 mmHg. \n3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. \n4. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n. \nTTE ___\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or \ncolor Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and \nglobal systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an \nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve \nshows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate \nthickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality (body habitus). \nCharacteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with \nelevated transvalvular gradient suggestive of moderate mitral \nstenosis. However, visually the mitral valve appears more \npliable. This elevated gradient may be due to an underestimate \nof the severity of mitral regurgitation in the setting of \nmoderately thickened mitral valve leaflets and chordal \nstructures. Alternatively, it may be that the subvalvular \nstructures are more thickened\/deformed and adversely affecting \nthe effective mitral valve orifice than is able to be \nappreciated on transthoracic imaging. \nGiven the internal inconsistencies on the current study, a \ntransesophageal echo for further characterization of the mitral \nvalve apparatus is recommended.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nseverity of mitral stenosis is qualitatively similar but the \nmitral valve area has decreased from 1.8 cm2 to 1.3 cm2 on the \ncurrent study. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension has markedly decreased and the right ventricular \nfunction has improved.  \n.   \nTEE ___ (preliminary)\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of \nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal \ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending, \ntransverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter \nand free of atherosclerotic plaque to 33 cm from the incisors \n(the probe was not advanced past the GE junction due to hiatal \nhernia). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are \nseen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.The mitral valve \nshows characteristic rheumatic deformity with bowing of the \nanterior leaflet and tethering of the posterior leaflet motion. \nNo mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is \nsevere valvular mitral stenosis (mean gradient 15mm Hg). Mild to \nmoderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with severe \nmitral stenosis. Mild ot moderate mitral regurgitation. \nPreserved global LV systolic function.\n.  \nTTE ___ \nLimited and focused imaging. Left ventricular wall thickness, \ncavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). \nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n.  \nTTE ___\nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows \ncharacteristic rheumatic deformity. There is severe valvular \nmitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to \nacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be \nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Severe rheumatic mitral \nstenosis. Grossly-preserved biventricular systolic function.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nfindings are similar. Both studies were focused on excluding \npericardial effusion. \n\nTTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:06:59 AM      FINAL \nThe left atrium is elongated. A small atrial septal defect is \nsuggested (clip 76) but could not be confirmed. Left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal \nwall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.9cm2). \nAn eccentric jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be \ndetermined. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ \n(pervalvuloplasty), the severity of mitral stenosis is markedly \nreduced and the mitral leaflets are more mobile.  \n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was admitted to the cardiology service. Her CXR on \nadmission showed likely worsening pulmonary edema on a \nbackground of ILD. Given lack of focal infiltrate, leucocytosis, \nand fever, abx were stopped. Steroids or other immunsupression \nwere held at the recommendation of her primary pulmonologist. \nShe was diuresed with IV lasix. Right and left heart cath was \ndone and showed no obstructive CAD, elevated PCWP, and MVA \n1.23cm2. Repeat TTE showed normal EF and moderate mitral \nstenosis, but was a limited study given body habitus. It was \nfelt that she may benefit from mitral valuloplasty as mitral \nstenosis was the best explanation for her recurrent CHF and \nelevated wedge pressures. During her time on the cardiology \nfloor, she was satting high ___ on ___, which the patient uses \nat home, and appeared to be breathing comfortably. TEE was done \nto look for evidence of thrombus. In the cath lab on ___ \nwhile attepmting valvuloplasty, when crossing the wire \ntranseptally, there was entry into the aorta. The case was \naborted, and the patient was transferred to the CCU for closer \nmonitoring.    \n. \nThe patient had a TTE post-procedure that showed no pericardial \neffusion or changes in the aorta.  She remained hemodynamically \nstable overnight in the CCU.  She continued to be diuresed with \nlasix.  Her insulin sliding scale was uptitrated for \nhyperglycemia.  The arterial and venous sheaths were removed \nfrom her groin the following day.  Repeat TTE demonstrated no \ninterval changes with no pericardial effusions.  She was called \nback out to the cardiology floor. CXR Pa\/Lat was ordered for AM \nafter call-out both to assess fluid status and to better \nevaluate possibility of underlying infectious process. Repeat \nCXR was much improved without pulmonary edema. Decision was made \nto take pt back for valvuloplasty on ___. Procedure was \nsuccessful and without complication; gradient improved (see ECHO \nand procedure report for full details). Pt's clinical status was \nmonitored for an additional day and lasix was titrated. She was \nd\/c'ed home with ___ and planned outpt follow-up with cardiology \nand pulm.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n(Per last d\/c summary)\n1. sertraline 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n2. prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): \nContinue until you see Dr. ___.  \n3. valsartan 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n4. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Reportedly at the OSH her ECG was concerning for \npossible atrial fibrillation w\/ complete heart block and both \natropine and transcutaneous pacing were attempted prior to \ntransfer. Of note, on arrival to ___ she was noted to be in \natrial fibrillation w\/ slow ventricular response and rates \n___. Sequence of causality is unclear: ie, if patient was \nbradycardic leading to decreased renal perfusion and thus an \nacidosis or if patient was acidotic due to renal failure (or \nother cause) leading to bradycardia. However, given lack of \nother end organ damage, more likely the latter. Her troponins \nwere negative so unlikely to be ischemic in etiology. She is on \nhigh doses of metoprolol and Diltiazem at home and denies taking \nmore medications than prescribed. On arrival, the pt was briefly \non a dopamine drip. In this setting, her metoprolol and \ndilitiazem were held and her metoprolol was slowly reintroduced. \nHer Bradycardia resolved. \n\n#Pulmonary Hypertension \nThe patient had evidence of volume overload with elevated JVP \nand lower extremity edema consistent with right sided heart \nfailure exacerbation. However with diuresis, the patient became \northostatic. RHC showed severe pulmonary hypertension. Likely \ngroup III iso oxygen dependent COPD but evaluation for other \ncauses was recommended by pulmonary. Group I work up included \n___, ANCA, CCP, anti-centromere pending at time of discharge, \nC3: 110, C4: 23, RF: <10, anti-RNP: negative, HIV: negative. She \nis s\/p RUQUS with doppler for portopulmonary HTN: No evidence of \nporto-pulmonary HTN. Group III work up: was unable to acquire \nfull PFTs - (spirometry, DLCO, lung volumes), has appointment on \n___. A Non con CT chest: demonstrated emphysema. Regarding \ngroup IV workup, a VQ scan was performed without evidence of PE. \n\n#HFpEF\nPatient with new diagnosis of HFpEF with evidence of right-sided \nHF likely secondary to COPD given elevated RV pressures on her \nTTE, right axis deviation\/low limb lead voltage on her EKG. She \nis chronically on 3L but had an increased oxygen requirement \nintitially. She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix but this \nwas ultimately held given mild ___. TTE this admission notable \nfor RV dilation w free wall hypokinesis. She was diuresed with \nIV Lasix transitioned to torsemide. Held ACEi in the setting of \n___. Received metoprolol as above, continued to hold diltiazem. \nImdur was discontinued given absence of angina. Continued with \nIV Lasix lead to orthostatic hypotension and RHC was done to \nevaluate for volume overload. PCWP was normal at 10 and CI was \nnormal at 2.82. PA pressure was ___ (47) consistent for severe \npulmonary hypertension as above. At discharge, diuretic was her \nhome dose of furosemide 10mg PO. \n\n#Atrial Fibrillation\nCHADS2VASC of 5 on warfarin. INR supratherapeutic on admission, \ninitially held diltiazem and metoprolol iso of bradycardia. High \ndoses of AV nodal blocking agents suggest that she has difficult \nto control rates. She had intermittent bouts of AF w\/ RVR to \n150s while her nodal agents were being held. We restarted her \nmetoprolol and uptitrated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6H (her \nhome dose of metop) and consolidated to 100mg succinate prior to \ndischarge. Anticoagulation was continued with warfarin 3 mg \nafter correction of coagulopathy. \n\n#Coagulopathy\nOn arrival pt's INR was supratherapeutic to 6.0 with prolonged \nPTT and decreasing platelets. Possibly in the setting of \ncongestive hepatopathy vs. due to changes in her PO intake prior \nto arrival. She was given PO vitamin K for three days, w\/ \nnormalization of her INR. Fibrinogen normal, blood smear showed \n1+ schistocytes. Warfarin was restarted as above. \n\n#Iron Deficiency Anemia \nPt w\/ Hgb ___ this admission. Required intermittent pRBC. Her \niron studies are consistent w\/ Fe deficiency anemia (Ferritin \n31, TIBC 300, Fe 17). Stool guaiac positive, but brown. Likely \nslow lower GI bleed iso supratherapeutic INR. INR reversed with \nvitamin K and Hgb stabilized. She should undergo EGD and a \ncolonoscopy as an outpatient, but had adamantly refused \ninpatient evaluation. She received IV iron repletion x3 days. \n\n#Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: \nPatient with non anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory \nacidosis. Bicarbonate is chronically around 18 but ph was 7.16 \non presentation. Non anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to \nrenal failure from worsening heart failure or injury due to \nhypotensive event. She required small quantities of bicarb \ninitially before her pH normalized. Renal was consulted while \nshe was inpatient and improved without intervention.\n\n___ on CKD: Patient has been seen by nephrologist with workup \nnotable for negative spep, upep. Baseline creatinine in ___ \n~1.5. Give exertional dyspnea, lower extremity dyspnea, and \nvolume overload, likely pre-renal from decreased effective \ncirculatory volume. Cr was 2.8 on admission and improved \ninitially with diuresis. Diuresis was restarted with increase in \nCr. on discharge Cr was 1.7. \n\n#Positive blood cultures \n#Leukocytosis \n#Possible Cellulitis\nShe was briefly on vancomycin for possible GPC bactermia, but \ngiven speciation as CoNS only in one bottle, suspect this may \nhave been contaminant. She had a full infectious workup which \nwas negative and we transitioned her to Keflex to complete a 5 \nday course for cellulitis (___). \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#Diabetes mellitus: on levemir 10U SQ qhs so switched to \nglargine 10mg qhs with sliding scale insulin while inpatient.\n\n#COPD: Baseline 3L of home O2 with extensive smoking history. \nContinued Advair.\n\n#gout: continued allopurinol, dose reduced to every other day in \nsetting of worsening renal function. \n\n#CODE: DNR\/okay to intubate \n#CONTACT\/HCP: ___ ___ (son) \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \n=====================\n[] Recommend performance of Full PFTs - spirometry, DLCO, lung \nvolumes, which are scheduled at ___ on ___. \n[] Recommend follow up with a pulmonologist (she preferred to \nsee a provider closer to home as outpatient follow up in ___ \nwill be challenging for her to keep.) If possible outpatient \nfollow-up should involve a local Pulmonologist (at ___) and PH \nspecialist at ___. She has had relatively extensive pulmonary \nhypertension workup however still needs PFTs. We have scheduled \nan appointment for her on ___ at ___ with a pulmonary \nhypertension specialist. \n[] Recommend referral to a cardiologist given her bradycardia \nwith heart block on admission and further titration of nodal \nblockers.\n[] Few small lung nodules measuring up to at most 4 mm. These \nare very likely benign, but noting emphysema may be appropriate \nto consider follow-up chest CT for surveillance in ___ year. \n[] Pt w\/ iron deficiency anemia this admission w\/ Hgb ___. Her \nstool was guaic positive, but pt did not have any BRBPR or \nmelena, so suspecting slow ooze. She was repleted with IV iron. \nConsider EGD\/Colonscopy as an outpatient.\n[] Consider transition from colesevelam to a statin.\n[] Consider continuing iron repletion as an outpatient. \n[] Diuretic management: she was discharged on lasix 10mg PO with \nnotable lower extremity edema, further attempts at diuresis were \nmade during her hospital course with worsening of her kidney \nfunction, absent of resolution of her edema and orthostasis. \n[] INR management: She was supratherapeutic with INR of 6 on \nadmission please continue to monitor INR closely on discharge. \nShe was ultimately continued on her home dose of 3 mg daily. \n[] Reduced allopurinol to every other day dosing due to \ndecreased CrCl, if Cr improves can consider increasing dose. \n[] Monitor BP. Stopped ACE because she was normotensive at rest \nand intermittently orthostatic. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Left lower lobe opacity is \ncompatible with atelectasis and\/or pneumonia. \n\nTTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left \natrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated \nThere is abnormal septal motion\/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure\/volume overload. The ascending aorta is \nmildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An \neccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the \nregurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with \nthe prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), the degree of \npulmonary pressures is much lower (likely underestimated as the \nIVC was not well visualized). No vegetations or abscesses \nvisualized.\n\nTEE ___: No vegetations seen on the cardiac leaflets. No mass \nor vegetation seen on the cardiac wires. Simple atheroma aortic \narch. At least moderate in severity eccentric mitral \nregurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to \nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  \n\nBLE Ultrasound ___: Limited study demonstrates no evidence \nof right or left lower extremity DVT. \n\nCXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the \nposition of the \ntracheostomy tube and of the pacemaker wires is unchanged. \nUnchanged moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of \natelectasis and substantial enlargement of the vascular \nstructures at the lung hilus. Unchanged moderate pulmonary \nedema. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. \n\nWBC scan ___: 1. Splenomegaly. 2.

MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent \nbacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood \ncultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite \nappropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent \nseeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both \nnegative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his \npacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult \nfocus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity \nultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot \nbut was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced \nat ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he \nhad negative blood cultures.  He was continued on vancomycin and \ndosing was changed to 1g q48h.  Further blood cultures were \nnegative.   Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular \nsource but it was not found during this hospitalization.  He \nshould be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date \nof his last positive blood culture, with last day ___.\n\n#. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an \nindwelling foley it was suspected that this might be \ncolonization however his cultures were positive even after \nchanging his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his \nurine as well as wound culture.  It was multidrug resistant \npseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day \ncourse.  He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when \ntrough < 1.  He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his \nurine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last \nday ___. \n\n#. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his \nMRSA bacteremia.  Other cultures returned positive as above.  He \nalso had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with \nseptic arthritis.  His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line \nholiday.  He was ruled out for C diff.\n\n#. Acute renal failure: BUN\/creatinine elevated to 70\/1.7 on \nadmission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor \nforward floor from chronic systolic CHF.  His creatinine slowly \nimproved with diuresis.\n\n#. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical \nventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to \ntrach mask for any length of time.  This was felt to be related \nto chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial \npulmonary edema.  Diuresis was difficult due to his large \nobligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix \n80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid.  His metolazone may \nneed to be decreased over the next several days if he is \noverdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen \nfor the few days prior to discharge.  On the day of discharge, \nhe was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the \n300's.\n\n#. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during \nthis admission.\n\n#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his \nhome carvedilol.  His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely \nand was not restarted due to renal failure.  He was diuresed \nwith IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his \ncreatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing \ndiuresis.\n\n#. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV.  He was started on a \nfentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control.\n\n#. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure \nremained stable during this admission.  He is off \nanticoagulation due to h\/o GI bleeding and hemothorax.  He was \ncontinued on carvedilol. \n\n#. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who \nrecommended the following:\n1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid \nmanagement. Turn q 2 hours.\n2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry.\n3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft \nsorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily.\n4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and \nwrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape.\n5. No tape on skin.\n6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days.\n7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to \nassist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with \nMepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days.\n8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal \ntissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to \nassess with edema.\n9. Waffles bilateral feet.\n10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily.\n11. Support nutrition and hydration.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Monitor I\/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given \nlarge doses of lasix and metolazone.  ___ need to back off on \nmetalazone if signs of overdiuresis.  However, would continue to \naim for -500cc daily I\/O balance.\n- Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM.  Give tobramycin \n320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0.\n- Continue vancomycin until ___ for MRSA bacteremia.  \nShould have trough measured intermittently to assess for \nappropriate dosing.\n- Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment\n- Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if \npossible.  Diuresis should help with this.\n- Please draw weekly labs: CBC\/diff, chem-7, LFTs and fax to \nInfectious disease R.Ns. at ___.

The cause for his fall is unknown, it may have \nbeen a mechanical vs. seizure-related fall as he said he was \nattempting to self-wean himself off his antiepileptic \nmedications.  \n\n# Hypoxia - Increased O2 requirement from 2L->3L NC.  Speaking \nin short phrases with significant SOB.  Pt was found still found \nto be hypoxic upon arrival to the medicine service, which was \nthought to be due to PE vs. COPD vs pneumonia. After he was \ntransferred to our service, we obtained a CTA to rule out PE.  \nThe CT did not show a PE and confirmed the fact that his COPD \nwas very severe, and it was thought that his baseline O2 sat \nwere likely 88-92% at home.  He had been placed on antibiotics \nfor possible pneumonia prior to transfer to medicine; he was \ntreated with Levofloxacin for presumed PNA started on ___, as \nwell as duonebs q6 and tramadol for pain.  On ___, per CXR, it \nappeared his PNA had cleared.

Improved from admission, but still persistently hypoxic \nwith supplemental O2 requirement. We gave him albuterol and \nipratroprium nebulizer treatments, prednisone 60 mg daily for a \n5 day course, supplemental O2, and encouraged use of incentive \nspirometry to help improve his respiratory status.  He \nclinically appeared improved, but was O2 dependent and required \nhome O2.

The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is severe \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is mildly depressed (Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 46%) \nsecondary to mild global hypokinesis with slightly worse \nfunction of the basal-mid inferior and inferoseptal walls. \nTissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular \nfilling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall \nis hypertrophied. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus \nlevel. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is \nmildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are \nstructurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild \n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension.

You were found to have worsening of your heart's pumping ability, causing extra fluid to back up into your lungs. This worsening of function was most likely due to having too much salt in your diet. Your heart rate was also found to go into a very fast irregular rate, likely because of having too much fluid. We gave you extra lasix (through the IV) to help get this fluid off of you. Your breathing had improved at the time you were discharged. It will be very important that you remain on a low sodium diet."}

He exercised \n9.25 minutes of ___ protocol ___ METS) and stopped due to \nfatigue. This represents an excellent physical working capacity \nfor his age. He denied any arm, neck, back or chest discomfort \nthroughout the test. There were no significant ST segment \nchanges throughout the study. The rhythm was sinus with no \nectopy throughout the study. There was an appropriate blood \npressure and heart rate response to exercise.\n.\nIMPRESSION: No ischemic EKG changes or anginal type symptoms. \nEcho report sent separately. \n\nEcho:\n\nThe patient exercised for 9 minutes 15 seconds according to a \n___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate \nof 142 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 156\/54 mmHg. The test \nwas stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise \nrepresents a very good exercise tolerance for age. In response \nto stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see \nexercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure \nand heart rate responses to stress.\n\nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 75 bpm and a \nblood pressure of 112\/60 mmHg. These demonstrated normal \nregional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right \nventricular free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no \naortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral \nregurgitation or resting LVOT gradient.\n\nEcho images were acquired within 56 seconds after peak stress at \nheart rates of 133 - 115 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate \naugmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight \ndecrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right \nventricular free wall motion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Very good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 2D \nechocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved \nworkload.\nSuboptimal study - sub-optimal image quality during \npost-exercise acquisitions.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSummary: ___ yo male with a history of CAD (2 DES placed into LAD \non ___, hyperlipidemia, HTN, and smoking history presenting \nwith left chest tightness.\n\nCORONARIES: The patient has known CAD with a cath report from \n___ and an intervention with placement of 2 DES into the \nproximal and distal LAD (lesions were hazy though FFR showed \npressure gradient difference). At that time, he only had single \nvessel disease. The patient presents with a different type of \ndiscomfort than his previous anginal pain. Cardiac enzymes x 3 \nwere normal and there were no EKG changes. The patient did not \nexperience any discomfort during the hospitalization. He was \ncontinued on Plavix, high dose aspirin, lisinopril and a statin. \nA beta blocker was held because he had an adverse reaction to it \nin the past. Since his discomfort was different than his prior \nand his last cath was only 2 months ago, it was decided to \nperform a stress echo on the patient. The stress echo was normal \nrevealing excellent physical endurance and a very good \nfunctional exercise capacity without ECG of 2D echo evidence of \ninducible ischemia. On discharge, the patient was given a \nprescription for sublingual nitroglycerin. He has a PCP \nappointment on ___ and ___ planned to have his PCP organize \ncardiology followup.\n-follow cardiac enzymes\n.\n# Dyslipidemia: From ___ his lipid panel showed LDL calc: \n75, HDL: 41, ___: 122, Total choleterol: 122. He was advised to \nincrease his simvastatin 10 mg dose for a goal of LDL<70. On \ndischarge, the patient was given a prescription for pravastatin \n20 mg daily because it will provide cost savings. \n\n# Left foot drop and associated numbness: The patient complains \nof difficulty pushing on the ball of his left foot. The physical \nexam revealed ___ dorsiflexion of the foot and sensory loss on \nthe lateral aspect of the calf wrapping on the the arch of the \nfoot. He did not have any back or neck pain. The remainder of \nhis neurological exam was normal. Since his symptoms are only \ndistal, they might be due to compression of a nerve. He was \ngiven an appointment at the neurology urgent clinic for further \nevaluation. \n\nOutpatient followup:\n1. Check LDL if at goal\n2.

Upon standing \nup, she felt dizzy and like she was about to fall backwards. She \nquickly plopped down on her behind to prevent herself from \nfalling.

The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Heart \nis borderline in size. Degenerative changes of the spine are \nnoted. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo ___ speaking F with CAD, chronic ear infection who \npresents with presyncope and fall at home.  \n.  \n# Presyncope: Likely orthostasis in setting of HCTZ use and \npossible mild dehydration. Hyponatremia may have also \ncontributed. Patient ruled out for MI. Neurological exam had no \nfocal deficits. There was no evidence of infection, however \nurine cx was pending at discharge. Patient has bradycardia ___ \nSSS, but this is a chronic issue and patient is asymptomatic \nwith bradycardia on the floor, and responded appropriately to \nexercise.  No events on tele. Patient was not orthostatic after \nreceiving gentle IVF. Physical therapy consult cleared patient \nfor independent ambulation with walker. \nHCTZ was discontinued. Patient will have her BP monitored off \nthis medication by her PCP, and may require a replacement \nmedication. Amitrityline was another candidate for causing \nconfusion and falls, however patient has noted benefit from this \nin terms of headaches. If falls continue, could consider \nstopping Amitrityline as well. \n. \n# Hyponatremia: Patient has h\/o hyponatremia in setting of HCTZ, \npossibly with mild SIADH component as well (since Na did not \ncompletely normalize when taken off of HCTZ). Patient had brain \nMRI as outpatient which showed only moderate microvascular \ndisease, which is unlikely to explain hyponatremia. Patient does \nhave evidence of COPD on CXR, but no other intrathoracic \npathology to cause SIADH. Urine osm were intermediate, so no \nclear SIADH picture. \nPatient did start taking HCTZ taking on her own over the last \nfew days for leg swelling. This likely accounted for worsened \nhyponatremia at admission. After holding the HCTZ, giving IVF, \nand encouraging POs, sodium was in normal range.   \nPatient was instructed not to take HCTZ, and to instead use \ncompression stockings for leg edema. \n.\n# Lower extremity edema: This was very consistent with chronic \nvenous insufficiency. Patient describes swelling that only \noccurs over the course of the day, and improves with rest and \nelevation. She has not been wearing compression stockings. \nOtherwise patient had no evidence of volume overload on exam. \nShe is at risk for CHF given CAD and past MI, and should \ncontinue to weight herself daily.\n.  \n# Sick sinus syndrome: Followed by Dr ___ as \noutpatient. No need for pacemaker given appropriate response to \nexercise. This episode is highly unlikely to be cardiac in \netiology. Sinus bradycardia on tele. Asymptomatic.  \n.\n# L gluteal pain: No fracture noted on L-spine films. Likely \nsoft tissue trauma from fall.    \n.   \n# Hypercalcemia: Borderline and chronic, with mildly elevated \nPTH in past. This degree is very unlikely to be causing \nsymptoms.    \n.  \n# Anemia: Hct 28 in baseline range.   \n.  \n# HTN:  continue lisinopril.  \n.  \n# Hyperlipidemia: continue statin   \n.  \n#: Headaches: chronic, likely related to chronic ear \ninfections\/mastoiditis.   \n.  \n# Otitis media: Right ear chronically infected.

You were treated with intravenous fluids and the HCTZ was stopped. You did well with physical therapy and your heart rate and blood pressure were normal. You also had leg swelling. This is caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which means that the valves in your veins get leaky over time and cause blood to pool in your legs.

The following day, \nheadache was relenting ___ pain. Also had fever of 102 and \ntook tylenol\/ibuprofen without relief of symptoms. He reports \nnausea and decreased PO intake. Denies vision changes, \nsensitivity to light, syncope, URI sx, chest pain, shortness of \nbreath, abd pain, diarrhea\/constipation, sick contacts. Has mild \nneck stiffness as well. He lives in ___, does a lot of\nyardwork. Has had exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, but none he \nmemorably recalls recently. No recent travel hx. No rash. He was \nfeeling entirely well prior to onset of these symptoms. Given \nterrible headache and fever, he presented to the ED. \n\nHospital Course to Date:\n\nThe pt was admitted for acute onset headache and fever. LP \nshowed a cell count of 141 with lymphocytic predominance and \nelevated protein to 100. He was initially started on bacterial \nmeningitis coverage, then narrowed to acyclovir based on \nnegative CSF stain and cultures. Doxycycline was added to cover \npotential lyme\nmeningitis. The pt's CSF came back positive for HSV PCR. Per ID \nrecommendations from ___: \"Would recommend continuing on \nAcyclovir for now but when safe for discharge can change to \nValtrex 1 gram po three times per day to complete 14 day course.\nIn setting of only low positive HSV 2 PCR and extensive outdoor \nactivity would also complete 14 day course of doxycycline even \nthough lyme is less likely.\" The pt improved dramatically. His \nheadache resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, he had no \nconfusion or neurologic deficits. He was transitioned to oral \nacyclovir the day before discharge and discharged on PO \nacyclovir + PO doxycycline for a total 14 day course.\n\nOf note, the pt was incidentally found to have an abnormally low \nHb on admission. He required 1u PRBC transfusion ___. He denies \nany known bleeding. GI was consulted and recommended EGD + \ncolonoscopy, performed ___. EGD showed diffuse erythema of \nthe mucosa with no bleeding noted in the antrum, consistent with \ngastritis. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential mass of \nmalignant appearance in the distal rectum completely encircling \nthe rectal verge. There were local ulcerations in the 12:00 \nposition. Colorectal surgery was consulted. They recommended \nfollow up at the colorectal cancer clinic. Follow up was \narranged prior to discharge and the pt was aware of the \ndiagnosis and need for follow up. The clinic and colorectal \nsurgery asked for a baseline CEA which was normal. They asked \nfor a staging MRI pelvis which did not show any spread of the \npresumed cancer. Pathology was sent by GI. Initial pathology \nshowed superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma. This was \npending at the time of discharge, though initial reports had \nshown the same diagnosis, so the pt was instructed to follow up \nwith GI. The GI phone number was shared with the patient and he \nwas instructed to call them directly if he did not hear from the \nclinic within 24 hours. The pt received a total of 2u PRBCs this \nhospitalization. Hb was 7.2 on the morning of discharge and the \npt received 1u PRBCs (the second unit this stay) on the day of \ndischarge after the Hb of 7.2 in order to ensure that his Hb did \nnot drop below 7.0 at home. Close follow up was arranged prior \nto discharge. The pt had no active bleeding at the time of \ndischarge.

After these episodes, \nshe returns to her baseline.\n\nOn this admission, she was evaluated for many causes including \ninfection; iatrogenic etiologies; PRES and vascular dementia. \n\n1) INFECTION: Ruled out for meningitis with an LP (negative for \nbacterial etiologies as well as HSV, CMV, and other viruses). \nShe received approximately 7 days of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and \naclyovir while awaiting study results, and 5 days of bactrim. \nShe also had significant pyuria but no bacteria grew on urine \nculture; however, 7d of cef\/vanc treated this possible \ndiagnosis. She had no other localizing signs or symptoms of \ninfection.\n\n2) IATROGENIC CAUSES: Though she didn't have characteristic \ntremors, her tacro was replaced by cyclosporin in case this was \ntoxicity. Several other medication changes were made, detailed \nunder transitional issues below, to minimize those that can \ncause confusion.\n\n3) POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES) and \n4) VASCULAR DEMENTIA: The patient did initially get better by \n___, but on subsequent days was more confused again, \nparticularly about higher-level functioning, such as not \nremembering how she gives herself insulin with meals. Given some \nongoing hypertension (pressures often in the 150s-170s, rarely \nas high as 180s-190s), and the relapsing-remitting presentation, \nthere was concern for PRES in the setting of immunosuppression. \nHer initial MRI was of limited utility due to artifact so a \nrepeat MRI was done on ___ which did not show evidence of PRES \nor lingering encephalitis. However, it did show microangiopathy \nand microvascular changes that could have progressed from prior \nscans -- not from most recent scan, however. \n\nCourse additionally notable for grossly normal electrolytes; EEG \nwith no seizures but intermittent right parietal slowing not \ncorrelating to findings on exam or imaging; and normal \nfolate\/B12\/TSH.\n\nThe patient was clearly improved (close to her \"real\" self, per \nher sister) at time of discharge, but still lacked some \nhigher-level functioning (not remembering how she doses insulin \nwith meals). It was not clear to us that glucose, blood pressure \ncould explain her course. Unfortunately, we did not come to a \nsatisfying diagnosis for the patient. Given what appears to be a \nstepwise decline, and her elevated blood pressures, and MRI \nfindings, we are concerned for vascular dementia, but if this \nwere to explain her previous episodes, we would expect her not \nto regain functioning in-between, and would expect worsening on \nimaging since ___. It could have been that N\/V lead to an \n___ causing transient Tacro toxicity and leading the patient to \ncommit errors in taking her medications, exacerbating confusion, \nbut this is entirely impossible to prove (and she had no ___ on \nadmission). Ultimately, we discussed with the family the need \nfor further outpatient workup and to minimize medications that \ncan contribute to confusion.\n\n# HYPERTENSION: Persistent on home medication, generally higher \nin the morning. Has been <180 except for rare exceptions, but \nregularly 150-170s. With proteinuruia that developed during \nadmission, likely not attributable to cyclosporin. Unclear if \nelevated from neuropathic pain or nausea as patient only \nintermittently endorses these. Increased amlodipine to 10mg \ndaily and ultimately held losartan due to ___. Continued \nmetoprolol. \n\n# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY and\n# PROTEINURIA in the setting of \n# ESRD s\/p LRRT: Generally maintained UOP >2L\/day. Did develop \nproteinuria on ___ (noted due periorbital edema), but this \ndowntrended. Of note, patient was switched to cyclosporine on \n___ due to concern for Tacro contribution to AMS and had an \n___ on ___ attributed to elevated cyclosporin levels, \ndowntrending by discharge. Mycophenolate and prednisone \ncontinued. There was initial concern for rejection based on \ntransplant ultrasound, but stable function and output were \nreassuring. \n\n# BRITTLE T1DM: Complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, and \nneuropathy. Insulin adjusted as per discharge medication list.\n\n# NEUROPATHY: Chronic problem for patient for which she is on \nmany medications that can contribute to altered mental status. \nHeld all of these, and she was able to tolerate. Discussed \nutility of adding back slowly and with help of a doctor to \nensure she is not more confused on any of them. \n\n# ANTICOAGULATION: Patient has a reported history of APLS, but \nthe diagnosis was not clear when Hematology was consulted in \n___. Patient prefers to be on anticoagulation per that \ndocumentation. Discussed reasoning for being on warfarin with \npatient and her sister. The 3 concerns the patient had were for \npulmonary embolism, stroke and protecting her stents. We talked \nabout the risks of bleed (which she has already had) on warfarn; \nthe role of aspirin in protecting her stents; absence of \nliterature using warfarin as empiric stroke protection in \npatients without AF (and risk of hemorrhagic conversion if \nstroke occurred); and the fact that her PE in the 1990s was \nprovoked and only required brief treatment. Though the risk of \nPE and potentially stroke are higher off of warfarin, her \nhistory of massive GI bleed and presence other modifiable risk \nfactors to reduce likelihood of stroke made discontinuing \nwarfarin a reasonable plan. We initially held warfarin in \nsetting of possibility for procedures and her INR was reversed \nfor LP; after discussing with patient we decided to continue to \nhold warfarin but touch base with outpatient providers. They \nagreed over email to the discontinuation. \n\n# NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Likely gastroparesis. Abdomen exam benign; \nLFTs and lipase normal. Per patient, had been going on for \nmonths (since pre-___). Became much less frequent while \ninpatient. Of note, family thinks this could be tied  to \nconfusion as primary neurologic cause. We discharged her with \nmetoclopramide in addition to ondansetron as PRN antiemetics. \n\n# CAD: home aspirin, atorvastatin, ranolazine, metoprolol. \nUnderwent triple angioplasty at ___ for CAD for angina in \n___. Atorvastatin dose-reduced to 10mg in setting of \ncyclosporin, which increases myopathies; it can be increased as \npatient tolerates, and she was discharged on 20mg. \n\n# PVD: Home cilostazol  \n# Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine  \n# History of GI Bleed: Home esomeprazole. \n\n# CODE: FULL (presumed)  \n# CONTACT: ___ (sister, ___  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==================\n#FOLLOW UP LABS: Please obtain Chem-10, CBC, UA, CK and \ncyclosporin levels on ___ and fax them to ___, MD, \nat the ___ Kidney ___ (FAX: ___\n#HYPERTENSION: If the patient's blood pressure is consistently \n>160\/90, please contact Dr. ___ at the Kidney \n___ @ ___\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\n-------------------\nNEUROPATHY MEDS: Gabapentin, duloxetine and vicodin all held in \nthe setting of altered mental status. The patient reported that \nher neuropathy was not bothering her significantly during \nadmission. Please consult with transplant team (specifically \ntransplant pharmacology) if patient has escalating neuropathy, \nas there may be an alternative medicine (such as pregabalin) \nthat could cause less confusion while also not interacting with \nimmunosuppression.\n#NAUSEA MEDS: Switched ondansetron for promethazine as an \nantihistamine may contribute more to confusion. Change approved \nby transplant pharmacy.\n#ANTIHYPERTENSIVES: \n-AMLODIPINE increased from 2.5mg BID to 10mg daily\n-LOSARTAN discontinued due to ___\n-METOPROLOL continued\n#ANTICOAGULATION: As described above, long conversation with \npatient and sister (HCP ___ resulted in holding Warfarin. She \nwas reversed with Vitamin K for her LP, so last day of \ntherapeutic coverage wasa ___. \n#ATORVASTATIN: lowered dose from 40mg to 10mg per day because of \nincreased myopathy risk in cyclosporine. She tolerated 10mg for \nseveral days and was increased to 20mg on day of discharge. Okay \nto increase back to 40mg if patient tolerates it without side \neffects. \n#RANITIDINE: This was held after confirming with GI Dr. ___ \n___. Concerned that large dose could contribute to patient's \nconfusion.\n#PRAMIPEXOLE: Held in setting ___ and not restarted due to \nnausea and headaches (presenting complaints) being side effect, \nand patient having significant restless leg syndrome during \ninpatient stay.\n\nOf note, she was stable and without worsened neuropathy, \nheadache or nausea for several days on this altered regimen \nprior to discharge.\n\nFOLLOW UP\n----------\n- Patient should see Dr. ___ about possible \ndiagnosis of vascular dementia vs. other etiologies for \nrecurrent\/worsening confusion.\n- MRI showed \"T1 hyperintense focus of the right thalamus on \nsagittal T1 sequence without correlate of signal abnormality on \nother sequences.  This is presumably artifactual in nature,\" but \nCT could be obtained to compare. \n- Hematology: Per ___ inpatient hematology note, patient \nshould follow up in ___ clinic for possible APLS, though doees \nnot appear from this documentation and concurrent labs that this \npatient carries this diagnosis. Conversation with patient about \nanticoagulation documented above. Likely does not need \nhematology f\/u, but this should be on the radar particularly if \nthe patient has other questions given her history. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were very confused, and your family was worried about you Many CT scan pictures of your head ruled out stroke or big problems in your brain. A lumbar puncture (LP) was negative for any bacterial infection. Studies sent off for infections caused by viruses were also negative. 7 days of antibiotics were given while waiting for these results. 7 days of antibiotics were given to treat a possible urinary tract infection, though your urine never grew bacteria. Many of the medicines you were on could cause confusion, so we stopped the ones we thought it was safe to stop. Your kidney transplant medicine, Tacrolimus, was switched to another called Cyclosporin. An MRI of the brain ruled out certain reasons for your confusion, but did show evidence of possible tiny strokes. Your blood pressure was very high, so your antihypertensive medicine was adjusted. Your sugars were low at first when you weren't eating, and then were very high, so your insulin was adjusted. We talked about stopping your coumadin\/warfarn because it is a dangerous medicine and you do not have a strong reason to be on it. Your creatinine went up, which we think was due to too much cyclosporin. This medicine was reduced. You got much better, but weren't 100% back to your normal self. We talked about the importance of following up with your outpatient team."}

Precipitant \nunclear; most likely due to malfunctioning pump. Other possible \nprecipitants included infection such as viral gastroenteritis or \npneumonia. Initial AG was 24. She was treated with insulin drip \nand her gap closed.  She was transitioned to BID Lantus and \nHumalog sliding scale insulin. She was seen by ___ who \nprovided recommendations for insulin titration. She was also \nseen by a diabetes nurse educator who provided recommendations \nto transition the patient back onto her pump prior to discharge. \nShe was transiently hyperglycemic on the night prior to \ndischarge, as expected given her transition from glargine and \nhumalog injections back onto her pump and received a correction \nbolus.

These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. \nHer MRA was unrevealing.  Her bloodwork revealed elevated \nlipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty \nacids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in \nthe past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly \nelevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the \nleast, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her \ndiet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. \nBecause she became angry when told of the possibilty of \ndiabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were \ndiscussed with both her son and daughter.

Not palpable; non-tender\nPsych\n- judgement: Good\n- orientation: Fully oriented\n- flat affect\n\n \nPertinent Results:\nEchocardiogram:\n\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild (non-obstructive) \nfocal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular \ncavity size is top normal\/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nnormal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no \nvalvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is \nlikely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic \nregurgitation. At least moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is \nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or \nvegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be \ndetermined. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There \nare no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe degree of AR is similar. The aortic root has slightly \nincreased in size. There is now a very small pericardial \neffusion. No valve vegetations are seen on either study.  \n\nKNEE X RAY- RIGHT ___: \nCement spacers within the right knee joint remain evident, \nsimilar in \nalignment to prior study. Also present is a long wire with \naccompanying \ncement beads within the distal femoral and proximal tibial \nmedulla. Hardware appears intact.
