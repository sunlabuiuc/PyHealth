The CBD brushing cytology \nfrom his prior ERCP was non-diagnostic. He had no apparent mass \nin the head of the pancreas on imaging but there remained some \nconcern for a primary pancreatobiliary tumor so he was planned \nto have a repeat ERCP and EUS the week he was admitted.\nBlood culture at ___ is growing Strep spp. He was treated with \nUnasyn for cholangitis as well as Strep bacteremia. BCx here \ngrew Strep anginosus. He had an ERCP on ___ with removal of the \nold stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm \nmalignant-appearing stricture of the distal CBD. Cytology \nbrushings were sampled. EUS was completed on which they \nvisualized a 1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the \ndistal CBD. FNB was performed x3. Pathology was consistent with \nadenocarcinoma.  \nAfter the plastic stent placement, his LFTs did not improve and \nbilirubin continued to rise. A repeat ERCP was done on ___ with \nremoval of the plastic stent and placement of a metal stent. \nAfter this, his LFTs started to improve. His Unasyn was changed \nto ceftriaxone and metronidazole for ease of dosing to complete \na 2 week course ___ - ___. A PICC was placed prior to \ndischarge. TTE did not show evidence of endocarditis.\n\n# ___ on CKD\nCr peaked at 1.8 from baseline 1.2. Most likely this was \nprerenal in the setting of cholangitis. It improved after ERCP, \nantibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. \n\n# PVT\nHe was found to have a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus on \nMRCP during his recent hospital admission and was started on \nenoxaparin. HIs home enoxaparin was initially held for ERCP, \nthen resumed. \n\n# Macrocytic anemia\nMacrocytic anemia is chronic. Baseline H\/H appears to be ___, \nso he is lower than baseline. He had no signs of bleeding.  \nRecent TSH, folate, B12, ferritin, and TIBC were wnl. Bilirubin \nis predominantly direct, so less likely hemolysis. Other \nhemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis. Acute on \nchronic anemia is perhaps ___ bone marrow suppression from \nsepsis. He was given 1 unit pRBCs for Hgb 7.6. \n\n# Metastatic clear cell RCC on chemotherapy\nHe is followed at ___ by Dr. ___. He was diagnosed in \n___ in workup of gross hematuria and flank pain. He underwent a \nlaparoscopic radical right nephrectomy in ___. He was found \nto have metastases to the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and \nhilar lymph nodes in ___. In ___ he was enrolled in an \nexperimental trial and started on sunatinib. His most recent CT \nshowed clinical response. He is currently in his regularly\nscheduled two weeks off on sunatinib. He had a surveillance CT \non ___ which showed  no evidence of local recurrence of \nmetastatic disease in the abdomen\/pelvis. \n\n# LUL pneumonia\nHe was found to have LUL opacity on CT chest ordered for \nsurveillance. He was also complaining of cough. He was on Unasyn \nwhile inpatient, then transitioned to ceftriaxone and \nmetronidazole for 2 weeks total, which should cover him for \npneumonia.\n\n# HTN\nInitially his home atenolol dose was halved due to concern for \ncholangitis\/impending sepsis.

No \ndense consolidative opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax \nidentified on single view.  Right-sided chest port is seen with \ntip likely terminating over the right atrium.  A left-sided \npacemaker is seen. Mild cardiomegaly appears similar. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nNo definite acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n\nTTE ___:\n==========\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global \nsystolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical \nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully \nexcluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. \nThe aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral \nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Trivial pericardial \neffusion. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. \nMildly dilated aortic sinus. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower\/normal.  \n\nCARDIAC PERFUSION ___:\n========================\nSUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: \nFor pharmacologic stress 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg\/ml) was \ninfused \nintravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. \n  \nFINDINGS:  Computer calculated end-diastolic volume is \nborderline at 114 cc, however, left ventricular cavity size \nvisually appears normal. \n  \nRest and stress perfusion images again reveal a small inferior \nfixed defect, likely secondary to attenuation artifact.  \nOtherwise, there is uniform tracer uptake throughout the left \nventricular myocardium. \n  \nGated images reveal normal wall motion. \n  \nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 62 %. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. \n  \nSTRESS TEST ___:\n==================\nINTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of \nhypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease \n(s\/p LAD PCI ___, referred as an inpatient for the evaluation \nof chest pain after serial negative cardiac biomarkers. He \nunderwent pharmacologic vasodilator perfusion study with \n0.4mg\/5ml of regadenason over 20 seconds prior to tracer \ninjection. There was no report of any chest, back, arm, jaw, or \nneck discomfort throughout the study. There were no significant \nSTTW changes. The vasodilator effect was reversed with 125mg of \naminophylline IV. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with \noccasional ventricular paced beats and no ectopy. There was an \nappropriate hemodynamic response to regadenason. \n\nIMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes. \nNuclear \nreport sent separately. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPATIENT SUMMARY:\n================\n___ male with PMH of CAD s\/p drug-eluting stent in ___, \nsick sinus syndrome status post pacemaker in ___, paroxysmal \natrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, and CLL who \npresented with midsternal chest pain and\ndiffuse ST-segment elevations consistent with pericarditis. \n\n#CORONARIES: Mid LAD stent  \n#PUMP: >55%  \n#RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  \n\nACUTE ISSUES: \n============\n\n#CHEST PAIN\n#PERICARDITIS\nPatient presented with ___ mid-sternal chest pain.  Patient's \ntroponins were negative X4 and d-dimer also negative which \nprovided reassurance of non-ACS and non-PE event. Recreation of \npatient's chest\npain with palpation of his chest wall was initially thought to \nbe most consistent with a costochondritis.  However, EKG \nobtained upon admission showed diffuse ST elevations consistent \nwith pericarditis and the patient was treated empirically for \npericarditis. TTE showed a trivial pericardial effusion and \npreserved global left ventricular systolic function with a \nmildly dilated aortic sinus. As the patient was unable to \nreceive NSAIDs due to known CAD and questionable GI bleed on \nlast admission, he was started on colchicine and prednisone. \nThis combination improved his chest pain overall, though he \ncontinued to have occasional episodes of midsternal pain leading \nup to discharge. These episodes were all self-limiting and were \nnot associated with any new EKG changes or troponin elevations.  \nThe patient underwent a stress test to ensure no ischemic \ndisease. He had no anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes \nduring the pharmacological stress and myocardial perfusion was \nnormal. The patient will be discharged on colchicine (0.6 mg \nBID) and a prednisone taper.\n\n___\nPatient's creatinine bumped from 1.1 on admission to 2.2 on \n___. Patient had been NPO prior to myocardial perfusion study \nand the etiology of the ___ was thought to be pre-renal. This \nwas supported by urine electrolytes studies which revealed a \nurine Na < 20 and urine Cl also < 20, consistent with sodium \navid state. The patient was treated with a 1.5 liter fluid bolus \nand his creatinine rapidly downtrended. The patient's creatinine \nwas 1.2 on discharge. \n\n#DM\nPatient's blood sugars were monitored closely during this \nadmission. He initially was very poorly controlled with blood \nsugars in the mid ___. This was likely due to a delay in \nrestarting his home dose of Lantus 75 units BID (he had been \ninitially placed on 50 units BID). Metformin was held on \nadmission and the patient was placed on a sliding scale short \nacting insulin in addition to above metformin. Given the \npatient's need for 2 weeks of prednisone therapy to treat his \npericarditis, ___ was consulted to provide input regarding \nadequate glucose control while on steroids during this time. The \n___ team recommended adding  5 units of Homolog with a \nHumalog pen before meals. This dose was deemed appropriate to \nhelp control blood sugars while on prednisone and also safe \nenough to be continued after the steroid taper has finished. \n\n#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation\nPatient in sinus rhythm upon admission. The patient's home \nmetoprolol was continued for rate control. The patient's home \nrivaroxaban was 10 mg. Unclear why patient on this dose but he \nhas been maintained on 10 mg daily since at least the end of \n___. Given the patient's normal kidney function at baseline, \nthe dose was increased to 20 mg daily prior to discharge in \norder to ensure adequate anticoagulation for atrial \nfibrillation.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n==============\n\n#CLL\nPatient presented with leukocytosis to 25.6 the setting of his \nunderlying CLL.  He takes ibrutinib as an outpatient which has \nbeen controlling his symptoms. This medication was unfortunately \nnot on formulary at ___. His wife was able to bring in his \nhome ibrutinib to take while hospitalized. Acyclovir was \ncontinued at his home dose.\n\n#CHRONIC PAIN\nPatient is taking a number of medications at home to treat \nchronic pain in the shoulders as well as in his back.  We \ncontinued all of these medications while he is in the hospital.\n\n#HYPOTHYROIDISM\nContinued home levothyroxine\n\n#INSOMNIA\nContinued home ramelteon, trazodone, ziprasidone\n\n#HLD\nContinued home atorvastatin and fenofibrate.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==================\n\nPatient hospitalized for chest pain without evidence of ischemic \ndisease. Troponin and stress test both unremarkable. EKG notable \nfor diffuse STE consistent with presumptive diagnosis of \nidiopathic acute pericarditis. Patient placed on prednisone \ntaper rather than NSAIDs given history of CAD and possible \nhistory of GIB. He was also started on colchicine which will be \ncontinued as an outpatient.

This pain became severe enough to make it difficult for you to breathe. You had laboratory tests which showed that you were not having a heart attack. You had an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. This showed that you may have inflammation of the lining around the heart (called the pericardium). You were given medications to control your pain and started on steroids to reduce the inflammation of the pericardium. You were seen by the diabetes doctor in order to better control your blood sugar while on the steroids. Your kidney's were injured while in the hospital. This was likely caused by taking off too much fluid. Your kidney function improved by the time you left the hospital.

An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) showed that your heart does not pump as hard as it should, a condition called \"systolic heart failure\". A procedure called an cardiac catheterization was performed to look at the blood vessels that supply the heart, as blockages to these arteries can cause this condition. Your cardiac catheterization showed clean blood vessels, which leads us to believe your systolic heart failure may be due to your heavy alcohol use. We have started you on several medications to protect your heart and help it beat stronger, but the most important thing you can do for this condition is to stop drinking alcohol."}

He was \nnot felt to be a good surgical candidate due to metastatic \ncancer and poor functional status. He wished to become CMO. \nVancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole were prescribed to \nimprove his abdominal pain and discomfort. \n\n# Hyponatremia, chronic: Patient presented with sodium of 118 at \noutside hospital The patient was given IV fluids until stable \nsodium level reached at 127. SIADH was thought to be a \nsignificant component of his hyponatremia, given his extensive \nmetastatic disease to his lungs.\n\n# Septicemia: Met sepsis criteria on ___.

He was started on iron supplementation.\n\n# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to metastatic liver \ninvolvement vs. EtOH use given elevated AST:ALT ratio.\n\n# Alcohol abuse: Patient reports chronic use of alcohol, \nmultiple beers and at least two shots of brandy daily. Has \ncontinued to drink despite lack of appetite prior to \nhospitalization. During his admission, he had no evidence of \nwithdrawal.\n\n# Melena: Patient had melena after stent placement. \nSigmoidoscopy on ___ showed tumor infiltration into the stent \nwith friable, bleeding tissue, which was the likely source of \nhis bleeding.\n\n# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril in the setting of low blood \npressures.\n\n# Hepatitis C: untreated.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\n=======\nMetastatic colon (adenocarcinoma) cancer\nColonic perforation\nHospital associated pneumonia\nSepticemia\n\nSecondary:\n==========\nAnemia\nHypertension\nHyponatremia\nHepatitis C\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired","summary":"He wastransferred from ___ ___ after a CT scan was concerning for colon cancer.

Brief \nhospital course by problem below.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n=============\n# IBD flare:\nIBD confirmed on CLS with biopsy (___). Began pred 40mg QD \non ___. Uptitrated to pred 60mg QD on ___ with hydrocortisone \nenema ___ I the setting of persistent disease. Presented to \n___ in setting of continued disease activity on ___ with \nsevere LLQ pain, bloody diarrhea, and non-bloody emesis.  \nImaging (MRE, CT Abd\/Pelvis, endoscopy) consistent with \nmoderate-to-severe ___ flare with no evidence of perianal \ninfection (abscess, fistula). Low suspicion for colonic perf s\/p \ncolonoscopy (no free air), pregnancy (negative test in ED), PID \n(given no CMT on ED exam or sxs) or trauma.  C diff and stool cx \nnegative. CRP downtrended appropriately over hospitalization. GI \nwas consulted for treatment recommendations. For pain, pt was \ntreated with IV tylenol to mild effect. NSAIDs and opioids were \ncontraindicated iso IBD flare. For her IBD, pt was treated with \nIV solumedrol 20mg (___).  She was also started on \ninfliximab on ___ after negative PPD, negative hepatitis A\/B\/C \nserologies, and s\/p 24h valacyclovir treatment for presumptive \nVZV reactivation.  Patient was tolerating a low residue diet \nwith no pain on discharge, denying loose bowel movement.  CRP \npeaked at 161 on ___. CRP on discharge 5.2. Discharge on PO \nprednisone 40mg with plan to taper by patient's GI.  Second \ninfliximab infusion on ___. \n\n# Hyperkalemia: \nOn ___, the patient was found to have a K of 6.0 on routine AM \nlabs. However, on re-check without fluids or other intervention \nand requesting no tourniquet, the patient's K normalized, \nsuggesting pseudohyperkalemia.

Per OB\/GYN, no need for \nemergent removal, and the patient was scheduled for outpatient \n___ on ___ at 9:45AM Chief resident clinic, ___ 8 at \n___.\n\n# Hydronephrosis:\nOn abdominal\/pelvic CT with contrast, incidental hydronephrosis \nwas found.  Per discussion with radiology, did not appear \nconsistent with obstructive uropathy secondary to \nnephrolithiasis.  No urinary complaints during hospitalization \nwith normal renal function and bland UA. ___ have passed a \nstone, but no residual evidence.  Cr remained stable over \nhospitalization.  Patient advised to seek medical care and\/or \nultrasound if develops urinary symptoms, flank pain, or nausea \nor if hydronephrosis persists.\n\n#Pain Control:\nDuring admission, opioids and NSAIDs were avoided.  Pain \nadequately controlled on IV\/PO acetaminophen.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Pt has an IUD which has invaded into the myometrium of her \nuterus and should be removed. An outpatient appointment with \nOB\/GYN has been scheduled on  ___ at 9:45AM Chief resident \nclinic, ___ 8 at ___..\n[ ] Pt has mild L-sided hydronephrosis found on CT scan which \nradiology feels is not related to a renal stone causing \nobstruction. Other causes of obstruction are possible. Pt should \nhave ultrasound in future to re-evaluate and further workup \nshould be considered if hydronephrosis is persistently present.\n[ ] Continue PO prednisone 40mg until ___.  Second infliximab \ninfusion on ___ for which patient will receive instructions from \nGI primary.  \n[ ] Consider DEXA scan for ankylosing spondylitis eval as an \noutpatient and prior to starting biologics\n[ ] Patient found to be HAV Ab negative.

We consulted our GI service, who recommended a plan for your treatment, which you received. We performed a lower GI endoscopy, which showed active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and was negative for other acute causes of your abdominal pain. We performed tests that showed no evidence of infection. We screened you for tuberculosis and hepatitis A, B, and C, all of which were negative, prior to beginning a new medication called infliximab. We gave you IV steroids, which eventually helped, but introduced infliximab to achieve better control of your IBD. We imaged your abdomen and pelvis, which incidentally showed that your IUD was incorrectly positioned. We asked our OB\/GYN service to see you for the IUD, who felt there was no need to remove it emergently. They arranged an appointment for you to have your IUD removed as an outpatient as below. We found that you had elevated potassium levels, which we believe was due to the way in which your blood was drawn. When we re-checked it, it was normal. We found a small increase in your liver enzymes, that began to normalize. This may be secondary to your new medication, of which you have 4 more days."}

Heart is mildly enlarged. Calcifications are \npresent in the aortic arch. Deviation of the trachea to the \nright is probably due to an enlarged thyroid. There are diffuse \nbilateral opacities with perihilar distribution and more \nprominent in the lower zone, consistent with moderate-to-severe \npulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also \npresent. The degree of pulmonary edema limits assessment for \nfocal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. \nIMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and moderate \nbilateral pleural effusions. \n\nEKG: Atrial fibrillation with PVCs, Rate 127, normal axis, no ST \nchanges, no TWI \n\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The estimated \nright atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). There is mild (non-obstructive) focal \nhypertrophy of the basal septum. The estimated cardiac index is \nnormal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Diastolic function could not be \nassessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion \nare normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is \nnot present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Mild mitral regurgiation. Moderate pulmonary \nhypertension. \n\nCXR ___:\nThere is volume loss\/ alveolar infiltrates in the lower lungs \nbut overall the\nappearance is much improved compared to the study from 2 days \nago. There small\nbilateral pleural effusions that are smaller compared to prior. \nThere\ncontinues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and moderate \nto severe\ncardiomegaly\nIMPRESSION: \nImprovement in fluid status both pulmonary edema persist.\n\nEKG ___:\nSinus rhythm. Occasional premature atrial contractions. Poor R \nwave\nprogression. There are biphasic T waves in the anterior leads. \nCannot\nrule out underlying myocardial ischemia. Compared to the \nprevious tracing\nof ___ biphasic anterolateral T waves are more pronounced. \nClinical\ncorrelation is suggested.\n\nMICRO:\n\nBlood Cx ___: negative\n\nURINE CULTURE (Final ___: \n      Culture workup discontinued.

She was on warfarin \nand metoprolol at home. She was started on amiodarone 200mg \ndaily in an effort to keep her into sinus rhythm. At discharge \nshe was in sinus rhythm.  \n\n# Volume overload: The patient presented with volume overload \nlikely due to flash pulmonary edema from afib. On admission she \nhad an elevated BNP, ___ edema, and findings of increased \npulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR. Echocardiogram \nshowed moderate pulm HTN, otherwise unremarkable. She received \ndiuretics with improvement in her volume status. By discharge \nshe was asymptomatic and feeling well. \n\n# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive during admission. \nOf note, her amlodipine and HCTZ were recently stopped due to \nlightheadedness and low pressures. Her lisinopril was increased \nwith better control of her pressures.

Chemical DVT ppx was \nheld at time of discharge after he was HIT positive and given \nrisk of bleeding with suction trauma.\n.\n# Respiratory distress: His respiratory distress has \ncurrentlyimproved. Post bronchoscopy, he was noted to be mildly \ntachypnic with RR ___ and was 88% on 15L NC. A CXR showed \nworsening pulmonary edema, and he received lasix with \nimprovement in PACU. He was transferred to the MICU for closer \nmonitoring. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and an \nIVF bolus prior to bronchoscopy. He is typically on 50% FIO2 \nwith his trach mask. He was weaned from the ventilator, and was \ncontinued on albuterol MDIs. He was also treated with vancomycin \nand cefepime for HCAP, until his sputum Cx grew coag-positive \nstaph sensitive to levofloxacin. He was started on an 8-day \ncourse of levofloxacin 750mg qday, of which the last dose will \nbe on ___. Lasix 40mg PO daily was restarted on day of \ndischarge. This should be titrated as needed.\n-We recommend keeping the patient on the ventilator (MMV) \novernight to decrease his work of breathing.\n.\n# Fever: The patient p\/w low grade fever\/temperature post \nbronchoscopy. His fever curve was trended, and cultures were \nsent. His urine and blood cultures showed no growth, while his \nsputum culture grew coag-positive staph as mentioned above. He \nwas continued on levofloxacin.\n.\n# Anemia: His anemia was stable after 2u pRBC prior to transfer, \nand his hematocrits remained stable. There was no further need \nfor transfusion.\n.\n# Asymetric swelling of LUE: His LUE was cooler than the RUE and \nmore swollen than the right, but still had good pulses. Although \nhis wife stated that his LUE has always been swollen, a doppler \nof the LUE was obtained which showed no evidence of DVT. The \nswelling appears to have reduced, although it still remains more \nswollen than the RUE. \n.\n# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (40-45%): The initial physical \nexam showed leg edema and his chest x-ray suggest mild CHF. He \nwas given 20mg of lasix in the PACU, and further diuresis was \nnot undertaken in the ICU. He was started on Lasix 40mg PO daily \n(Previous home dose) on day of discharge. This should continue \nto be monitored. He was given free water flushes through his G \ntube for hypernatremia, which resolved during his stay.  \n.\n# Low platelet count: His platelets fell from 273 on admission \nto 107 prior to discharge. This drop was consistent with \nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which his heparin was \ndiscontinued. This was confirmed as his heparin antibody from \n___ was positive. His PLT count on ___ is 111. He was put on \npneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis given risk of bleeding with \nsuction.\n-He should not be given heparin.\n.\n# Hypernatremia: As above, he was given free water flushes for \ncorrection of his hypernatremia, which appears to have resolved. \nFree water flushes were continued at time of discharge.\n.  \n# Oral candidiasis: PO fluconazole was stopped prior to \ndischarge.\n.\nOnly evidence of bleed is suection trauma in L maintstem \nbronchus, needs to come back in 6 week from ___ for rpt \nbronch\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 975mg PO Q8H  \ncarvedilol 3.125mg PO BID  \nCitalopram 20mg PO daily  \ndocusate 100mg PO BID  \nferrous sulfate 300mg PO daily  \nfluconazole 100mg PO Q12H  \nfolic acid 1 mg po daily  \nlasix 40mg PO daily  \ngabapentin 300mg PO Q12H  \nheparin 5000U SC Q12H  \nlisinopril 2.5mg PO daily  \nMVI daily  \nomeprazole 20mg PO daily  \nprotein supplement daily  \nalbuterol inhaler 4 puffs Q2H prn wheezing  \nsimethicone 80mg PO Q8Hprn  \noxycodone ___ po q4h prn  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every \neight (8) hours as needed for pain.  \n2. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every \neight (8) hours as needed for pain.  \n3. carvedilol 3.125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n4. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n5. docusate sodium 50 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) milliliters \nPO BID (2 times a day).  \n6. ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO once a day.  \n7. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n8.

An element of muscle spasm was \nalso thought to be likely, based on his symptoms. He was given \nmorphine and Percocet initially for pain control. He was \ntransitioned to Percocet only, and low-dose Flexiril was added \nto aid with control of muscle spasm, as well as heat to the \narea. His symptoms continued to be significant and limiting to \nhis progress with physical therapy. The Chronic Pain Service was \nconsulted, and recommended a new medication regimen. He was \ngiven Toradol x 2 doses, and started on standing Tylenol, \ngabapentin, and tizanidine as well as oxycodone as needed. The \nfollowing morning his symptoms had improved, and he was able to \ntransition more easily in and out of bed. He was transferred to \na rehabilitation facility for extended physical therapy. \n.  \n*)Atrial fibrillation: also with a history of complete heart \nblock with a pacemaker, rate-controlled on admission. His INR \nwas found to be supra-therapeutic at 4.4, and his Coumadin was \nheld for one day. On re-check, his INR continued to increase, so \nhis Coumadin was stopped. Metoprolol was continued during his \nhospitalization. His INR will need to be followed, and Coumadin \nre-started once INR is less than 3. \n.\n*)Elevated creatinine: his creatinine was at his baseline at 1.1 \non admission, with an increase to 1.3 after he received Toradol. \nThis will need to be followed up with repeat labs; he did not \nreceive any additional NSAIDs and was not discharged on any. On \nthe day of discharge his creatinine had begun to trend back \ndown.\n.  \n*)Hypertension: BP was well-controlled on his home medication \nregimen.  \n.  \n*)Chronic diastolic heart failure: felt to be at baseline on \nadmission. His home medication was continued.  \n.  \n*)BPH: finasteride and Flomax were continued during his \nhospitalization.\n.\n*)Hyponatremia: stable at baseline. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n- eplerenone 25mg every other day  \n- finasteride 5mg daily  \n- Lasix 20mg daily  \n- Latanoprost 0.0005%  \n- meclizine 12.5mg as needed  \n- metoprolol 50mg twice daily  \n- Flomax 0.4 twice daily  \n- Valsartan 320mg daily  \n- Coumadin as directed ___  \n- aspirin 81mg daily  \n- coenzyme Q10  \n- vitamin D 400mg daily  \n- folic acid  \n- glucosamine 750mg daily  \n- multivitamin  \n- niacin 400mg daily  \n- omega 3 fatty acid  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Also, metastatic \nlesion within the T7 vertebral body has increased in size.  \nThere is new enhancing anterior and posterior epidural \nmetastatic disease from T10 through L1 levels. \n  \nThere is stable extensive metastatic disease within the lumbar \nspine and \npelvis as described above. \n  \nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo man history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic \nlow back pain, renal cell carcinoma s\/p metastases to lumbar \nspine, sacrum, right iliac wing s\/p XRT and chemotherapy \n(sutent) admitted with worsened low back pain. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n-------------\n# Low back pain: Mr. ___ was admitted with acute on chronic \nlow back pain.  He has known extensive renal cell carcinoma \nmetastases to lumbar spine, T2, and T7.  MRI on this admission \nshowed steady progression of the thoracic mets, particularly \nwith T2 collapse and epidural extension.  Given concern for T2 \nvertebra stability, neurosurgery was consulted and recommended \nthat he have a full TLS (Somi) brace at all times while upright. \n He, however, is not required to wear the brace when lying down \nat HOB <30 degs.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough \nthat significant neck movement is prohibited.  The brace is \ndesigned to restrict neck movement - and thus precludes Mr. \n___ from driving.  With his interests in driving and his \ncollection of multiple cars\/trucks, this news was naturally \nquite distressing to Mr. ___.  Social Work was consulted to \nprovide some coping.  It was communicated to Mr. ___ that it \nis unlikely that he will be able to drive ever again.  He would \nnot be able to drive with the brace because of neck \nrestrictions; he would not be able to drive without it because \nthe risk of paralysis with T2 vertebra instability; and patient \nis already at significant risk with the high doses of opiates \nand pain medications.  During this stay, here, there was no \ncauda equina symptoms.  Pain was controlled with dexamethasone, \nButrans patch, tramadol, NSAIDs, cyclobenzaprine, oxycodone PRN. \n The Butrans patch was doubled to 20 ug\/hr to provide stronger \nbaseline relief of the pain.  ___ evaluated the patient and felt \nhe was stable for discharge but would benefit from home physical \ntherapy.  Training on the placement on removal of the brace was \nprovided to the patient and his wife.  The ___ was \ncontacted with paperwork stating that the patient is not \nmedically safe to drive.  The patient refused to sign this \npaperwork. \n\n# Renal cell carcinoma: s\/p XRT and chemotherapy (Sutent).  Mr. \n___ has been off the Sutent due to significant mucositis and \nnausea.  There has been near complete resolution of these \nsymptoms.  There is some residual sacral wounds and wound \nconsult made the following recommendations: Mepilex to back \nblisters to protect from friction from straps, Criticaid clear \nto perianal fissures Qshifts or pRN, pressure redistribution \nmeasures, limit sit time to 1 hour at a time.  He will follow \nwith Dr. ___ to determine what chemo to \ninitiate as an outpt\n\n# Anemia: Mr. ___ has had decrease in Hct but no clear \nevidence of bleed.  There was no GI bleed noted and blood \npressure was stable.  Hematocrit was followed serially. \n\n# Hiccups: patient was started on a trial of chlorpromazine 25mg \nTID x 7 days, which he will continue upon discharge\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Hypertension: stable, patient was continued on atenolol and \nhydrochlorthiazide.\n\n# GERD: patient was continued on home omeprazole.\n\n# Anxiety: no anxiolytics were provided while patient was \nadmitted.\n.\nTRANSITIONS OF CARE\n-------------------\n# Follow-up: patient will follow up with Oncology on discharge, \nfor an appointment to be arranged after discharge.  He will be \ndischarged with a Somi brace and wheelchair.  He should have a \nfull TLS (Somi) brace on at all times while upright.  He, \nhowever, is not required to wear the brace when lying down at \nHOB <30 degrees.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough \nthat significant neck movement is prohibited.  He will get home \nphysical therapy.\n\n# Code status: patient is confirmed full code.\n\n# Contact: Wife ___ ___\n\n \n___ on Admission:\n- ATENOLOL 25 mg daily\n- Butrans 10 mcg\/hour Transderm Patch. 10 mg patch once weekly\n- COLCHICINE 0.6 mg tablet. 1 tablet daily \n- CYCLOBENZAPRINE 10 mg tablet QHS PRN restless legs\n- DEXAMETHASONE 4 mg BID\n- HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25 mg daily \n- LORAZEPAM 0.5 mg PRN \n- OMEPRAZOLE ___ 20 mg Daily\n- ONDANSETRON HCL Dosage uncertain\n- OXYCODONE ___ mg q4h PRN pain\n- PROCHLORPERAZINE MALEATE ___ mg QID PRN nausea\n- SUNITINIB [SUTENT] 12.5 mg 3 capsule mouth daily x 2 weeks, \nthen 1 week off.\n- TRAMADOL - tramadol 150 mg daily \n- ASPIRIN 325 mg daily\n- NAPROXEN SODIUM [ALEVE] 220 mg PRN\n- TROLAMINE SALICYLATE [ASPERCREME] - Dosage uncertain -  (OTC)\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

As you know, you were admitted with increased pain in the back. MRI of the spine showed progression of the cancer involvement of the T2 and T7 vertebrae. The T2 vertebra (below the neck), in particular, was collapsed and revealed extension of the break into the spinal canal. It is for this reason, that you should have the brace in place while you are upright. This can be removed when you are lying down flat with the head below 30 degrees from horizontal. You have verbalized that you understand the risks and potential consequences, namely paralysis, that can occur from not wearing the brace. Because of the limitations with the neck brace, you should not drive for risk of getting into an accident. Driving without the brace is equally dangerous, as the T2 vertebra may press on the spinal cord and lead to paralysis - and thus a risk for yourself and others. The ___ ___ has been contacted and your license is no longer active and you are not permitted by law to be driving."}

We did tests that showed you were having a heart attack. You underwent a procedure called a cardiac catheterization which showed a blockage in one of the vessels that brings blood to your heart which was the cause of your heart attack. A stent was placed to keep the blood vessel open. Your hospital course was complicated by a slow heart rate which is often seen after the type of heart attack you had. We started you on medications called blood thinners to prevent the stent placed in your heart from getting clogged. It is very important that you take this medicine every day. We also gave you medicines to prevent another heart attack."}

The heart size is normal. \nThe mediastinal contours are unchanged, including leftward \ndeviation of the trachea at the level of the clavicular heads, \nraising suspicion for right thyroid enlargement. There are no \npleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Bibasilar reticulonodular opacities, slightly decreased on \nthe right and increased on the left compared to prior radiograph \nfrom ___, concerning for a multifocal infectious \nprocess.\n2. Persistent rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of \nthe clavicular heads, raising concern for right thyroid \nenlargement. If not already performed, a non-emergent thyroid \nultrasound could provide further information.\n\n___ CTA CHEST\n  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental \nlevels bilaterally. Scattered aortic calcifications are seen. \nThe heart is grossly unremarkable aside from left atrial \nenlargement. Dense coronary artery calcifications are seen. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. There are no pathologically \nenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or axillae. \nExtending from the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the \nthyroid, there is a 3.2 x 3.0 cm hypodense nodule, causing mild \nleftward shift of the trachea at this level (2:8).\n  There are ground glass and more consolidative opacities along \nthe dependent aspects of both lower lobes, possibly atelectasis, \nalthough aspiration pneumonitis should also be considered, \nespecially given the presence of high-density material within \nthis region that likely represents previously aspirated oral \ncontrast material. Within the left upper lobe, there is a 9-mm \nground glass nodule (2:31). Additionally, there is a 2-mm right \nupper lobe nodule (2:28). The airways are patent to the \nsubsegmental levels bilaterally. There is a trace left pleural \neffusion.\n  This study was not optimized for evaluation of the \nintra-abdominal contents. Minimal central pneumobilia is not \nsignificantly changed compared to CT from ___ \n(2:55-56).\nBONE WINDOW: There is diffuse dimineralziation. Within the \ndistal right clavicle, there is a 12 x 11 mm sclerotic lesion \n(2:10). Additionally, within the posterior right seventh rib, \nthere is a 5-mm sclerotic lesion (2:30). Multilevel degenerative \nchanges of the thoracic spine are noted. There is also \nossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n2. Bilateral lower lobe ground glass and consolidative \nopacities, raising concern for aspiration pneumonitis in the \nappropriate setting, although atelectasis could also explain \nthis finding. Punctate hyperdense foci in the dependent portions \nof the lower lobes suggest there may have been prior aspiration.\n3. 12-mm sclerotic focus in the distal right clavicle and 5-mm \nsclerotic focus in the posterior right seventh rib are \nnonspecific, but blastic metastases are not entirely excluded \ngiven the history of prostate cancer. Correlation with a bone \nscan could provide further information if PSA is sufficiently \nelevated to suggest any substantial probability of bone \nmetastases.\n4. 9-mm left upper lobe ground glass pulmonary nodule should be \nfurther  evaluated with CT in three months; an additional 2-mm \nright upper lobe nodule could be reassessed on the same followup \nstudy, noting the history of malignancy.\n5. 3.2-cm right thyroid nodule could be further evaluated with \nnon-emergent thyroid ultrasound, unless this has previously been \nperformed.\n\n___ ADENOSINE STRESS ECHO\n70 and 140mcg\/kg\/min of Adenosine was was infused intravenously \nfor 4.5 minutes. Infusion was terminated due to rapidly \nprogressive chest and throat discomfort in the setting of a \nbrief period of second degree AV block. AV block resolved \nfollowing termination of the infusion. Symptoms resolved 1 min \npost-infusion. No significant ST changes were noted.  \nINTERPRETATION: \nLeft ventricular cavity size is severely enlarged. \nRest and stress perfusion images reveal a severe inferolateral \nfixed perfusion defect and moderate inferior and anterolateral \nfixed perfusion defects. Gated images reveal global hypokinesis. \nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 25%.\nCompared with the study of ___ the fixed inferior wall \ndefect is worse and the inferolateral and anterolateral fixed \ndefects are new. There has also been mark reduction in left \nventricular ejection fraction as well as severe enlargement in \nLV cavity size.\nIMPRESSION: \n1. New severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral fixed \ndefects. Moderate inferior wall fixed defect, worse since ___.\n2. Global hypokinesis with marked reduction in left ventricular \nejection fraction since most recent prior study. EF 25%.\n3. Severely enlarged left ventricular cavity size since prior \nstudy.\n\n___ L HIP XRAY\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in \nthe appearance of the hemiarthroplasty, which remains well \nseated and without evidence of acute hardware-related \ncomplication.\n\n___ LLE DOPPLER ULTRASOUND\nDuplex evaluation was performed on the left lower extremity \nveins.  There is normal compression and augmentation of the \ncommon femoral, proximal femoral, mid femoral, distal femoral, \npopliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins. There is normal \nphasicity of the common femoral vein bilaterally.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with complicated PMH notable for CAD s\/p multiple PCI, \nsystolic CHF (LVEF 35% in ___, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, \ntype II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer, and \nrecent admission for stabilization of atraumatic left femur \nfracture, now re-admitted from rehab for exertional angina \nduring physical therapy.\n\n# Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: Patient \nreadmitted with anginal chest pain, brought on by exertion & \nrelieved with nitroglycerin. ECG without evidence of acute \nischemia\/infarction, but serial cardiac biomarkers showed mild \nnew elevation in troponin-T peaking 2 days after chest pain \nepisode. He was started on long-acting nitrate (Imdur 30 mg \ndaily). He did have one chest pain episode in-house which \nresolved with 1 tab SL TNG. He underwent adenosine nuclear \nstress test (H\/O intolerance to both Persantine and dobutamine), \nwhich showed new severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral \nfixed defects, interval worsening moderate inferior wall fixed \ndefect, and global hypokinesis LVEF decreased to 25% (from 35% \nin ___. Given the absence of objective evidence of a large \narea of ischemia (rather than prior infarct, as documented) and \nthe small troponin elevation, conservative medical therapy was \npursued rather than invasive risk stratification with coronary \nangiography. He was continued on his home medications: aspirin, \nmetoprolol (at recently increased dose), Lipitor, dabigatran. \nPlavix was not started given bleeding risk (H\/O radiation \nproctitis plus admission 6 mos ago for BRBPR).\n\n# Chronic systolic heart failure with acute diastolic \nexacerbation, LVEF 25%: Last TTE in ___ demonstrated moderate \nregional LV systolic dysfunction  with inferior and \ninferolateral hypokinesis. Pharmacological MIBI showed interval \nworsening heart failure, LVEF decreased to 25% with increase LV \ncavity size, all likely due to silent infarcts at home during \nthe intervening ___ years, since MIBI also showed extension of \nprior infarcts and new infarcts in an LAD distribution. During \nthis admission, he appeared euvolemic for several days, with no \nevidence ___ or pulmonary edema. He then developed asymmetric \n___ edema after receiving small amount IVF on ___ (asymmetry \nlikely due to recent left hip surgery, ___ negative for DVT). \nThis ___ edema was likely dependent edema after being up to a \nchair for many hours. The patient should have his legs elevated \nwhile in bed or sitting in chair and should wear compression \nstockings. He was continued on home metoprolol. We note that he \nis not on Lasix or an ACE-I (despite his diabetes and CAD); \nstarting ACE-I as an outpatient should be considered once renal \nfunction normalizes (as BP tolerates).\n\n# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On Pradaxa for anticoagulation \nplus metoprolol for rate control, which were continued. HR \ntrended ___, no episodes RVR.\n\n# Recent aspiration pneumonia: On admission, patient was midway \nthrough a treatment course of levofloxacin for presumed \naspiration pneumonia, which he completed on ___. CTA chest \nshowed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for \naspiration pneumonitis. Patient gave history of feeling he was \nswallowing his own saliva. Speech and swallow service performed \nbedside evaluation, suggested patient's diet be restricted to \nnectar-thickened liquids, soft solids, and pills crushed in \napplesauce. They also recommended video swallow, which we \nrequested to be performed in rehab.\n\n# Chronic kidney disease: Patient has H\/O chronic kidney \ndisease; review of ___ years of creatinine levels show baseline \n1.2 - 1.5. Cr was 1.1 on admission; rose to 1.3 by the follow \nmorning (likely due to contrast load received for CTA chest), \nthen normalized thereafter but worsened in the setting of volume \noverload. Urine lytes showed low urine Na, which could be due to \neither pre-renal physiology and\/or worsening congestive heart \nfailure, as above.\n\n# S\/P left femoral hemi-arthroplasty: Patient had been \ndischarged to rehab for <24 hours. He had previously been \nhospitalized on the medicine service where he underwent left \nhemiarthroplasty by ortho for atraumatic (suspected pathologic) \nleft femur fracture, concerning for possible involvement of \ntreated prostate cancer -- pathology returned negative. He \nworked with ___ during this admission. Ortho follow-up discharge \nappointments arranged (see below). Patient had repeat hip X-ray \nhere, which was unchanged from prior, no acute fracture.\n\n# Incidental Chest CT Finding: Bilateral lung nodules, sclerotic \nlesions rib and clavicle: Findings noted on CTA chest obtained \non admission. Concerning for possible metastic disease, \nespecially given recent atraumatic left femur fracture. Lung \nnodules need surveillance imaging in 3 months. Patient was \nre-scheduled for heme-onc follow-up including review of \npathology from recent intra-operative left femur bone biopsy \nobtained during last admission.\n\n# Depression\/Grief: Patient noted to be suffering from \ndepression and grief over his wife's recently-diagnosed terminal \npancreatic cancer. Social work followed during this admission. \nPsychiatry consulted for repeated expressions of passive \nsuicidality to nursing staff; they felt patient was suffering \nsignificantly but was not an imminent threat to himself. Both \npsychiatry and social work recommended ongoing therapy, which \npatient accepted only after significant encouragement but seemed \nto appreciate. He was not interested in pharmacotherapy. Ongoing \ntherapy at rehab and beyond was recommended for coping with his \ngrief.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Angina - monitor for symptoms, use of SL NG, consider \nlong-acting nitrate dose increase to 60 mg as BP tolerates.\n2. CHF - Patient not on ACE-I on admission, none started given \nacute renal failure but should be revisited in cardiology \nfollow-up.\n3. RECENT LEFT HIP ARTHROPLASTY- has ortho f\/u wwith films. \nPatient concerned about \"clicking sounds\" but left hip films \nhere unchanged. Please discuss with patient what to expect in \nterms of rehabilitation, functional status & timeline.\n4. HEME\/ONC - follow-up imaging findings demonstrating chest \nwall lytic\/sclerotic lesions, as well as bilateral lung nodules. \n___ need further onc follow-up given hx of prostate cancer.\n5. GRIEF\/DEPRESSION - ongoing difficulties coping with his own & \nwife's medical diagnoses. Needs therapist and\/or pharmacologic \nmanagement. \n6. SUSPECTED OSTEOPOROSIS (per last discharge summary) - Patient \nneeds review of possible osteoporosis and initiation of \nbisphosphonate; Ca\/Vitamin D already started.\n7.

No clear\netiology for her symptoms was identified: TSH was normal,\naldosterone level was normal but renin moderately low and the\nratio was 171. This ratio was noted to be elevated in the lab\nresult and her PCP commented that addition of spironolactone did\nnot help. In addition, a CT AP was done at that time that was\nunrevealing for a visible adrenal adenoma to explain the\naldosterone level. She had a renal US that showed unilateral 60%\nstenosis. Her cardiologist and PCP did not believe these \nfindings\nto be enough to explain her symptoms.

She has experienced 5 episodes in\nthe past 2 months and has gone to the hospital each time. It is\nnot associated with any other precipitating factors. Most likely\ndue to moderate-severe AS (mean aortic gradient 41mmHg and ___\n.7cm2 found on TTE on ___. Endocrine factors contributing to\nlightheadedness have been ruled out with normal thyroid (x2 TSH)\nand normal aldosterone levels. Neurologic etiology less likely\ngiven negative MRA\/MRI at ___ and arrhythmias less likely\ngiven none noted on any of her previous admissions.\n\n#Severe aortic stenosis\nWorsening AS found on TTE in ___ compared to ___ of this\nyear, as well as more frequent symptoms.

TSH was normal, and aldosterone level was\nnormal but renin moderately low (ratio 171), consistent with\nsecondary hyperaldosteronism. CT showed adrenal adenoma to\nexplain the aldosterone level. Renal U\/S showed 60% renal artery\nstenosis on right, possibly due to AS and peripheral\nvasoconstiction. Pheochromocytoma was thought to be unlikely so\nurine metanephrines were not sent.

The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global systolic \nfunction (biplane LVEF = 60%). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly \ndilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation \nis seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. \nMild aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nregional and global left ventricular systolic function is much \nimproved. \n\n___ LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION: Coronary angiography:  \nright dominant\nLMCA: Normal\nLAD: Very tortuous with prominent intramyocardial bridge.  There\nis systolic compression but not diastolic compression.   There \nis\na very large diagonal diagonal branch without stenosis. \nLCX: The LCx was a large vessel.   There was a large OMB1 \nwithout\ndisease.  The LCx terminated in a large vessel with prominent\nleft posterolateral branches.  There was no disease within the\nLCx or its posterolateral branches.  \nRCA: The RCA was a dominant vessel with a large PDA and smaller\nright posterolateral branch.    The RCA was free of disease. \nASSESSMENT\n1. Insignificant coronary artery disease with a prominent\nintramyocardial bridge.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with HTN, COPD (2L home O2), with recent admission for \nhypoxic respiratory failure with course complicated by new-onset \ncardiomyopathy thought to be stress-induced, referred from her \nPCP's office with ECG changes and chest pain. EKG with diffuse \nTWI in V2-V6 and patient had epigastric pain, severe, but \nsimilar to her ___ pain. She had bilateral lower \nextremity edema and her proBNP was elevated (but lower than \nduring her hospitalization). She responded well to Lasix 40mg IV \nx 1. Her trops were negative and once she got to the floor her \nEKG changes actually resolved. Heart catheterization on ___ \nrevealed no significant CAD, but presence of an intramyocardial \nbridge over the LAD. Her chest pain and EKG changes likely due \nto coronary vs esophageal vasopasm. We started Imdur 30mg daily \non admission, but this was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed \nthat her EF normalized (60%). Her dilitiazem (discontinued on \nlast admission) was restarted on discharge. \n\n# ECG Changes \/ Diffuse TWI\nHer ECG findings are most likely secondary to coronary and\/or \nesophageal vasospasm. The patient's pain resolved with morphine \nand had three negative troponins. EKG changes resolved once \npatient arrived on floor. Imdur 30 mg was added initially for \nthe pain and ECG changes. Cardiac catheterization on ___ \nshowed no significant coronary artery disease but myocardial \nbridge of LAD. Imdur was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed \nthat her EF normalized (60%) and her dilitiazem (discontinued on \nlast admission) was restarted on discharge.  \n\n# Stress-induced cardiomyopathy\nPatient recently discharged with new EF reduction to 35%, \nthought to be most consistent with a stress-induced \ncardiomyopathy. The patient had continued the regimen on which \nshe was recently discharged, including furosemide 20mg daily. \nShe appeared volume overloaded on admission and received IV \nlasix x1. She was trialed on 40 mg PO lasix daily, however, due \nto hypotension, this was reduced to prior dose of 20 mg daily. \nDue to distribution of T-wave changes on EKG, it was thought \nthat her cardiomyopathy may have been ischemic. Cardiac \ncatheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary \nartery disease but intramyocardial bridge over LAD. Repeat TTE \non ___ showed normalization of her EF to 60%. She continued \nhome aspirin and losartan, but metoprolol was discontinued. \nPrevious home diltiazem was restarted on discharge due to normal \nEF. She was kept on 20 mg furosemide daily, as she likely has \ncomponent of diastolic heart failure. She did not appear volume \noverloaded on discharge.\n\n# GERD \/ ___ Esophagus \nLast EGD ___ with diffuse gastritis and evidence of \n___. Symptoms on admission were suggestive of esophageal \nvasospasm, which may account for diffuse TWI. She continued home \nPPI and was started on imdur 30 mg daily, but this was \ndiscontinued on discharge. Home diltiazem (discontinued on \nprevious admission due to depressed EF) was restarted on \ndischarge after TTE revealed normalization of EF to 60%.\n\n# Hyponatremia  \nChronic based on her labs, and at her baseline around 131. Has \nbeen previously attributed to SIADH which was again considered \nduring her last hospitalization as her sodium saw no improvement \nwith either fluid administration or diuresis. Sodium remained \nstable.  \n\n# Hypertension  \nHistory of hypertension, previously on diltiazem. This was \ndiscontinued after her last hospitalization. She continued her \nhome losartan. Diltiazem restarted on discharge.\n\n# COPD: On home O2 since prior hospitalization. Long term \nsmoker. She was started on tiotropium on day of discharge for \npresumed COPD. She reported that she has outpatient PFTs \nscheduled.\n\n# Anemia, normocytic: Patient with history of normocytic anemia \nsince ___, with baseline HCT between ___. She was \npreviously anemic in ___, but had normal H\/H most recently \nin ___. Iron studies during this admission were suggestive \nof anemia of chronic inflammation.\n\n# Bladder Spasm: She continued home oxybutynin.  \n\n# Right hip pain  \nThought to be due to known spinal stenosis and chronic right hip \n \npain. She continued home acetaminophen, lidocaine patches.  \n\nTransitional Issues:\n====================\n- patient started on tiotropium for possible COPD; needs \noutpatient PFTs\n- patient needs electrolyte check at her PCP appointment on \n___\n- diltiazem extended release 180 mg daily was restarted on \ndischarge due to resolution of her cardiomyopathy\n- patient kept on furosemide 20 mg daily as she most likely has \nsome diastolic heart failure\n- discharge weight: 55 kg\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
