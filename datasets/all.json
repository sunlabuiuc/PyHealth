The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or \ncolor Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior \ndyskinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis\/akinesis. \nDoppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) \nleft ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The remaining left \nventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve \nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial posterior mitral \nleaflet flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate \n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is \nan anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat \npad.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with regional left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. Probable partial flail \nof the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with consequent at \nleast moderate mitral regurgitation that is directed anteriorly. \nNormal right ventricular function.\n\nCARDIAC CATH ___:\n\nEMODYNAMICS RESULTSBODY SURFACE AREA: 2.04 m2\n HEMOGLOBIN:8.4 gms %\n FICK  \n**PRESSURES\nLEFT ATRIUM {a\/v\/m}**  \nAORTA {s\/d\/m}110\/53\/63  \n**CARDIAC OUTPUT\nHEART RATE {beats\/min}63  \nRHYTHMSINUS  \n \n**ARTERIOGRAPHY RESULTSMORPHOLOGY% STENOSISCOLLAT.

Elevated INR: patient is on coumadin for history of PE, and \nshe presented with INR 4.8 in setting of 1 week of nausea and \nvomiting. Elevated INR likely due to poor nutrition. INR was \ntrended and coumadin restarted ___ when INR was 1.8. INR 1.5 on \nday of discharge.\n\n2. Fall: patient fell down some stairs at restaurant and had no \npreceding symptoms. EKG on admission was at baseline. We felt \nfall to be mechanical in nature due to poor vision related to \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\n3. Hypotension: patient initially presented with hypertension \nsbp in 190s, then became hypotensive when working with ___ sbp in \n___. She was orthostatic. Home anti-hypertensives discontinued. \nIn setting of fall with elevated INR there was concern for \ninternal bleeding so CT abd\/pelvis, CT head, and CXR (PA & \nlateral) were obtained which were negative for evidence of \nbleeding. She refused IVF so we encouraged po intake which \nresulted in stabilization of blood pressures. Discharging home \non blood pressure medication regimen of metoprolol succinate \n12.5 mg daily and losartan 50 mg daily. Amlodipine discontinued \nin favor of increasing losartan.\n\n4. Anemia: pt has baseline anemia but Hgb downtrended to 6's in \nhouse. As this was associated with hypotension, bleeding was \nruled out with imaging described above. She was transfused 1 \nunit PRBC's with return of her hgb to baseline. No evidence of \nGI bleeding during hospitalization.\n\n5. Vitreous, retinal hemorrhage: patient reported blurry vision \nduring hospitalization. Ophthalmology consulted who diagnosed \nvitreous and retinal hemorrhage. Recommended to keep HOB \nelevated, avoid bending over or straining. Instructed to follow \nup with ___ clinic.\n\n6. Diabetes mellitus: patient followed at ___. Home regimen \ncontinued in house initially but patient experienced \nhypoglycemia into the 70's in the morning. ___ consulted and \npatient agreed to change pm Lantus from 20 units to 16 units. \nShe will also change her correction factor to 14.\n\n7.

No evidence pulmonary embolus.\n2. Bibasilar atelectasis with small amount of superimposed \nconsolidation at the right base.  Suggest followup with chest \nradiograph to ensure resolution of this appearance.\n3. Low-attenuation liver compatible with fatty infiltration. A \ntiny hyperdense focus in the right lobe of liver likely \nrepresents tiny transient perfusion anomaly.\n\n___ CXR\nInterval improvement in bibasilar streaky densities consistent \nwith subsegmental atelectasis. A small focal area of \nconsolidation cannot definitely be excluded.\n\n___ CXR\nInterval development of bilateral predominately upper long \nairspace opacities common given the rapid development this \nlikely reflects pulmonary edema however bilateral pneumonia \ncould have a similar appearance.\n\n___ CXR\nBilateral pulmonary opacities which may represent edema, \npneumonia or ARDS. Slight interval worsening on the left.\n\n___ CXR\nSlight improvement in the perihilar edema but further \ninvolvement of the left basilar lung parenchyma probably \nrepresenting broncho pneumonic consolidation or possibly pleural \neffusion.\n\n___ CXR\nPersistent hilar pulmonary edema on the left side with new \natelectasis on the right lung base.\n\n___ CT CHEST WO CONTRAST\nBilateral pulmonary opacities most consistent with pneumonitis. \nPossible mild underlying emphysema. Bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nDiffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.\n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, \ncavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal \n(LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left \nventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the \nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are three \naortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nno mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. \n\n==== ___ ====\n___ ECG\nSinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Diffuse low \nvoltage QRS complex. Cannot rule out prior myocardial infarction \nof indeterminate age. Compared to the previous tracing of \n___ the findings are similar.\n\n___ CXR\nNew upper enteric drainage tube passes into the nondistended \nstomach and out\nof view.  ET tube in standard placement.\nDense consolidation in the left lower lobe, is probably \natelectasis. Predominantly perihilar consolidation and more \nextensive ground-glass opacification involving the upper lungs \nhas worsened slightly since earlier in the day.  Differential \ndiagnosis is broad and includes pneumonia and pulmonary \nhemorrhage.  Heart size is difficult to assess but probably not \nenlarged. Pleural effusion is small, on the left, if any.  No \npneumothorax.\n\n___ CXR\nAs compared to the previous image, the patient has been \nextubated. The nasogastric tube was removed. The lung volumes \nhave decreased, revealing new sounds of parenchymal atelectasis \nat the lung bases. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity in the \nperihilar lung regions on the left is overall unchanged. \nModerate cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural effusions. \nThe overdistension of the transverse colon is constant in \nappearance.\n\n___ ECG\nSinus tachycardia. There is a late transition with tiny R waves \nin the anterior leads consistent with probable myocardial \ninfarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the \nprevious tracing of ___ low voltage is no longer present \nand ST-T wave changes are more diffuse.\n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No \natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler or \nintravenous saline injection at rest. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the \ndistal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls and distal \ninferior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic. The \nremaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or \nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular \nchamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free \nwall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no \naortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely \nrepresents a prominent fat pad. Left pleural effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional biventricular systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (mid-LAD \ndistribution) vs. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Mild pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation. No \nintracardiac shunt identified. Dilated ascending aorta. \n\nCompared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) \nof ___, regional biventricular dysfunction is now \nidentified and c\/w CAD vs. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. \n\n___ CT CHEST WO CONTRAST\nIsolated areas of ground-glass opacification peribronchial \ninfiltration in the lower lungs could be foci of infection, but \noverall the findings, including small pericardial and pleural \neffusions, suggest volume related pulmonary edema--the non \ngravitational distribution is unusual but not unheard of.\nPersistent acute nonobstructive right middle lobe collapse.\nMild to moderate aneurysmal dilatation ascending thoracic aorta, \nchronic.\n\n___ CXR\nAs compared to the previous radiograph, there is no overall \nchange.  The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are \nartificially increased in density given the lower lung volumes \nof the patient.  Moderate atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung \nregions persist.  No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged course \nand position of the right PICC line.\n\n___ LIVER US\n-No identifiable sonographic correlate to previously \ndemonstrated subcentimeter liver lesion on CT.  Fatty hepatic \ninfiltration again demonstrated.\n\n___ RUE US (R\/O DVT):\nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper \nextremity.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with a history of HTN, HL, and significant smoking history \nwho was admitted to ___ with cough and hypoxia in the \nsetting of recent viral illness, transferred initially to our \nICU for worsening hypoxia requiring intubation, treated for CAP, \nfound to have new stress induced dilated cardiomyopathy (c\/w \nTakatsubo's).\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n================\n# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: \nMost likely multifactorial, due to viral pneumonia with \nsuperimposed atypical pneumonia, as well as newly developed \nheart failure with fluid overload.  She decompensated during \nhospitalization at ___ and required intubation, so after \ncompleting course of CTX\/azithromycin for community acquired \npneumonia, she was broadened to vancomycin \/ cefepime \/ \nazithromycin + TMP\/SMZ + high dose prednisone for HCAP, PCP, and \nCOPD exacerbation.  Autoimmune\/other non-infectious etiologies \nseem less likely given lack of improvement on high-dose \nsteroids. In spite of significant smoking history, ___ PFT's \ndid not show obstructive defect. Initially lower suspicion for \npulmonary edema given apical predominance of pulmonary \ninfiltrates, though BNP slightly up at 800 on admission to ___ \n___.  She self-extubated on the morning of ___, and \nremained stable on high flow oxygen.  She was narrowed to \nceftriaxone \/ azithromycin to complete a course for atypical \ncommunity acquired pneumonia once mycoplasma and chlamydia Abs \nwere positive (at ___, although for mycoplasma, IgM was \nNEGATIVE).  Given failure to wean oxygen for several days after \nextubation, a TTE was obtained, which revealed newly depressed \nLVEF = 35 %, regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD \n(mid-LAD distribution) vs. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and BNP of \n9353 (see discussion below).  She was diuresed and oxygen \nrequirements improved, and ultimately she was discharged on home \nO2, with 2L requirement.\n\n#Atypical Community Acquired Pneumonia:\nPatient initially presented to ___ with URI symptoms, \ncough, and hypoxia. Treated with azithromycinand ceftriaxone, as \nwell as Bactrim out of c\/f PCP and ___ for presumed COPD \nexacerbation, initially improving, then decompensated in terms \nof oxygenation, requiring BiPAP, prompting intubation and \ntransfer to ___, where she was broadened to vancomycin and \ncefepime, and restarted on Bactrim and pulse steroids with \nprednisone. HIV at ___ was negative. Also with negative \nflu swab at OSH (received flu shot this year). Urine strep and \nlegionella Ag negative at OSH..  Bronchoscopy and BAL cultures \nhere negative, including PJP.  Mycoplasma IgG and Chlamydia \nantibodies were positive.  She was narrowed to ceftriaxone \/ \nazithromycin to complete a course for atypical community \nacquired pneumonia. She self-extubated on ___, and weaned from \nhigh flow to nasal cannula. Given continued wet cough, patient \nwas provided with a flutter valve to aid with mucous clearing, \nand treated with guaifenesin and benzonatate. Persistent O2 \nrequirement this admission, with 2L requirement at rest and with \nactivity prior to discharge, discharged with home O2 (has \nrequired discharge with home O2 in the past). \n\n#Acute Systolic Heart Failure\/ #stress cardiomyopathy:\nGiven patient's continued O2 requirements following extubation, \nEchocardiogram was done and showed new EF of 35% and apical \nhypokinesis, consistent with either CAD (mid LAD lesion) versus \nTakatsubo's. Echocardiogram done at OSH on ___ with EF of >55%. \nBNP of 9353, no known hx of CHF.  Given patient's lack of \nanginal symptoms and normal troponins, felt likely \nstress-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (Takatsubo's) in the \nsetting of acute illness. Cardiology was consulted, recommended \nstarting on ASA 81mg, metoprolol, and ___, as well as diuresis. \nDiuresed initially with Lasix, and later with ethacrynic acid \nout of concern for Lasix-induced otoxicity (discussed below). \nPatient diuresed well, and her volume status improved, and \npatient ultimately discharged on 20mg PO daily Lasix given low \nlikelihood of true allergy (see discussion below). Per \nCardiology, will need a repeat Echocardiogram in ___ weeks, and \na follow up cardiology appointment with Dr. ___. Of note \npatient's home diltiazem was discontinued on discharge, given \npatient's new medications and stable pressures in the 100-110 \nrange systolic. Will need to address restarting this medication \nas an outpatient with PCP and at cardiology follow up \nappointment. Per report, this medication is for esophageal \nspasms.\n\n#Bilateral Hearing Loss:\nPatient noted to have hearing loss during her ICU stay, ___ days \nafter starting 20mg IV Lasix boluses for aforementioned heart \nfailure. Out of concern for Lasix-induced ototoxicity, this \nmedication was stopped and listed as an allergy, and patient was \nsubsequently diuresed with ethacrynic acid. On exam, noted to \nhave significant cerumen impaction, which was felt more likely \nthe cause of the patient's hearing loss. ENT recommended \ndisimpaction of cerumen and subsequent audiogram to further \nassess hearing once cerumen removed. Patient treated with \ncarbamide peroxide drops, tap water irrigation, as well as \nmineral oil, without full clearance of cerumen. Will continue \nwith ear drops and follow up with PCP. Given improvement in \nhearing with treatment of cerumen, discharged on PO Lasix per \nabove.\n\n# Hyponatremia, chronic:\nAlso with noted hyponatremia this admission, with history of \nhyponatremia, possible history of SIADH. Initially noted at ___ \n___ and ___ to be consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, \nhowever persistent in low 130s despite initial fluid \nresuscitation. Subsequently volume overloaded, potentially some \ncomponent of hypervolemic hyponatremia, however little \nimprovement with diuresis, and persistent now despite patient \nbeing largely euvolemic. Possible SIADH from chronic pain (hip \nand back, as well as foot), defer further management to \noutpatient setting.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n=================\n#Presumed COPD:\nPatient with extensive smoking history, now with persistent O2 \nrequirements this admission. Has previously been discharged on \nO2 in the past, however not on home O2 at baseline. Noted to \nhave normal PFTs in ___. With continued diuresis per above, \nable to wean oxygen to 2L, and discharged home with O2 per \nabove. Consider repeating PFTs as an outpatient.\n\n# Hypertension:  \nContinued home diltiazem initially.  No known history of a-fib.  \nChanged to metoprolol in the setting of heart failure, and can \nbe further titrated to heart rate. Has follow up with cardiology \nin ___, can readdress anti-hypertensive regimen if \nheart failure from likely stress-induced cardiomyopathy has \nresolved.\n\n# Anemia:  \nNo transfusion requirement.  Remained stable without evidence of \nbleed. \n\n# Bladder Spasm:  \nChronic, continued oxybutynin.  \n\n# Right hip pain: \nMost likely due to known spinal stenosis and chronic right hip \npain. Continued APAP and started lidocaine patches, has \nappointment on ___ to receive steroid injection. \n\n# GERD:  \nStable, with known ___ esophagus. Continued home PPI.\n\n# Tobacco Abuse: Former smoker, with ___ pack-year history. \nRecently quit on ___. Counseled on continued \nsmoking cessation, especially in the setting of oxygen therapy. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==================\n#Stopped diltiazem (reportedly for esophageal spasm), will need \nto address restarting this medication as an outpatient with PCP \nand at cardiology follow up appointment.\n#Stopped ranitidine given drug interaction with metoprolol, \nconsider restarting as outpatient with close monitoring of heart \nrates and blood pressure, or if no longer needs to continue \nmetoprolol following cardiology visit.\n#Started on ASA, metoprolol, and losartan for new heart failure \nfrom stress-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.\n#Follow up ECHO with cardiology at appointment in 4 weeks \n(___).\n#Continue using home oxygen until your follow up with your \nprimary care doctor.\n#Continue with the ear drops ___ drops in both ears twice daily \nfor 4 days.\n#Follow up with your primary care doctor on ___ for your \nrecent hospitalization in the intensive care unit for pneumonia, \naddress cerumen impaction.\n#Call to make an audiogram appt (___) after wax is \nremoved.\n#Consider orthopedic referral at next PCP appointment for hip \npain and spinal stenosis.\n#Further workup of patient's anemia deferred to outpatient \nsetting.\n#Workup of unintentional weight loss:  Reports 12 lb \nunintentional weight loss in past 2 months.  Last ___ \nin ___. Last ___ ___ with diverticulosis, internal \nhemorrhoids, rec'd repeat ___ years.\n#There was concern for Lasix allergy given decreased hearing. \nThis was felt to be less likely given improvement in hearing \nafter removal of ear wax.\n#Patient discharged with Lasix 20mg daily. Please check \nelectrolytes in 1 week.\n#Consider repeat PFTs as an outpatient. \n#Consider repeat chest imaging with CXR in approximately 1 \nmonth, as CTA chest at ___ had recommended repeat \nimaging to assess for improvement\/resolution in bibasilar \natelectasis seen on CTA on ___.  \n# Code: Full (confirmed)\n# Emergency Contact: Husband ___ is HCP (cell ___, \ndaughter ___ is alternate ___ son ___\n \n___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

However, you were noted to have a persistent oxygen requirement with a nasal cannula, and a study of your heart showed new heart failure, likely caused by your lung infection. You were treated with medication to help remove excess fluid from your body, and you improved."}

Patient stabilized and \ncalled out to cardiology service where she underwent diuresis \nwith improvement in BNP and mental status. Her course was \ncomplicated by persistent a fib with RVR for which she was \nplaced on digoxin and low dose metoprolol with good response. \nShe underwent PEG tube placement due to poor PO intake, though \nshe was cleared for pureed foods by the speech team. She was \ndischarged to rehab. She may benefit  from cardioversion once on \nanticoagulation for appropriate duration. \n\nACUTE PROBLEMS:\n===============\n# HFrEF (EF 23%)\n# Tachymyopathy vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy\nPatient presented with poor PO intake\/failure to thrive and \nreceived volume resuscitation. This, in conjunction with \nunidentified newly reduced ejection fraction, likely triggered \nsubsequent Afib with RVR. Rate control was attempted with \nmetoprolol. This precipitated cardiogenic shock requiring brief \nadmission to the MICU. On TTE she was found to have newly \nreduced EF of 23% (compared to prior 42%) with global \nhypokinesis most likely from tachymyopathy due to poorly \ncontrolled atrial fibrillation prior to this admission. Missed \nischemic event was considered but cardiac cath was not pursued \ndue to frailty. Was trialed on Lasix boluses and subsequently \nbumex gtt prior to transfer from ICU. On transfer to the floor, \npatient was continued on lasix gtt and converted to PO Lasix \nwhen euvolemic. She was started on digoxin for rate control of \nafib (see below). Afterload reduction was managed with \ncaptopril. She was eventually tolerating low-dose metoprolol \nafter rate control with digoxin. Discharge weight was 136 \npounds. She will follow up with cardiology NP in one week and \nDr. ___. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation\nFirst diagnosed in ___ after suffering from stroke. \nCHADSVASC of 8. She was prescribed Diltiazem prior to this \nadmission. Upon arrival she was found to have afib with RVR in \nthe low 100s and she was volume depleted. With volume repletion \nand uptitration of metoprolol for rate control, she became \nhypotensive. All rate control was held. She was subsequently \nstarted on digoxin for rate control, and low-dose metoprolol was \nsubsequently added and tolerated. Due to intermittent swallowing \nissues\/pocketing meds in her mouth, home dabigatran had to be \nconverted to apixaban so that she could receive it via her PEG \ntube. During this hospitalization she was considered for \ncardioversion but she had reportedly missed some doses of her \nanticoagulation prior to admission. Going forward, she may \nbenefit from cardioversion. She has consistently been \nanticoagulated since ___ (she was on it prior to that but it \nwas held briefly for her PEG tube placement). At discharge she \nwas still in atrial fibrillation but with heart rates in the \n___. \n\n# ___\nCr peaked at 2.4 with limited urine output. FeNA suggestive with \nprerenal\netiology, consistent with cardiorenal as driving etiology with \ncontribution from ATN from shock described above. Her creatinine \nimproved to 0.8 at the time of discharge.\n\n# Coagulopathy\nUnclear etiology. liver function seems normal. Vitamin K \nchallenge 5 IV x3 days with minimal improvement. \n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n# Delirium\nRecent stroke, likely acute delirium iso critical illness. CT\nhead negative. She became quite hypernatremic after starting \ntube feeds, which correlated with her cognitive decline. She \nimproved substantially after correction of her serum sodium but \nstill remained occasionally disoriented to place\/time.\n\n# Failure to thrive\n# Concern for dysphagia \n# Weight loss\nNo clear etiology, as decreased PO intake and weight loss began \nprior to recent stroke. Patient's function and PO intake have \nappeared to continuously worsen since stroke. CT \nabd\/pelvis\/chest ___ with no e\/o malignancy or occult \ninfection. Per discussion w\/daughter, daughter would like to \nmaximize nutrition (including tube feeds) given this is an acute \ndecline. The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow \ntime and was cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids. It was \ndecided that she could take in whatever desired PO that she \nwould like, and that would be supplemental to tube feeding. She \nunderwent PEG placement on ___ and was started on bolus tube \nfeeds 3x daily. Tube feeds should not be given 2 hours prior to \nAM levothyroxine or two hours after levothyroxine in order to \nallow maximum drug absorption. \n\n# C diff\nPatient developed diarrhea in early ___. C diff stool PCR was \npositive. She completed a 10 day course of PO vancomycin: \n___. She was no longer symptomatic at discharge.\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE ISSUES: \n======================\n# OSA\nHas diagnosis of severe OSA, on BIPAP at home though compliance\nis unclear. She should continue BiPAP at ___ nightly. \n\n# Left MCA stroke with dysarthria and right hemiparesis on \n___\nNCHCT from ___ showed sequela of recent L MCA infarction. No \nevidence of hemorrhagic transformation. She has right sided \nhemiparesis. Continue atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily \n\n# Type II diabetes mellitus\nRestart home metformin and glipizide at discharge. Her blood \nglucose was appropriate on 10 units of Lantus daily, but this \nmay require adjustment once she gets on a regular schedule of \nbolus tube feeds.\n\n# Hypothyroidism\nContinue home levothyroxine 75 mcg daily. TSH and FT4 were \nchecked and were appropriate. Tube feeds should be held two \nhours prior to AM dose and two hours after AM dose to allow \nmaximum absorption.\n\n# GERD\nContinue pantoprazole 40 mg daily \n\n# Anemia\nShe is a ___ Witness and cannot receive blood products. \n\n# Hypertension\nContinue captopril, consider changing to lisinopril 2.5. She did \nnot tolerate higher doses of lisinopril in-house and became \nhypotensive.\n\n=========================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=========================\n[ ] Discharge weight: 136 pounds\n[ ] Discharge diuretic: Lasix 20 mg daily\n[ ] Diltiazem was discontinued and should not be restarted due \nto her reduced ejection fraction.\n[ ] Dabigatran was switched to apixaban because dabigatran \ncannot be given through PEG tube and she occasionally pockets \nmedications in her mouth.\n[ ] Consider switching captopril to lisinopril. In the past she \ndid not tolerate doses higher than 2.5 mg lisinopril due to \nhypotension.\n[ ] Continue to hold tube feeds 2 hours before and 2 hours after \nAM levothyroxine to allow adequate drug absorption.\n[ ] Continue bolus dosing of tube feeds 3x daily with PO intake \nas desired. Cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids.\n[ ] Consider cardioversion for atrial fibrillation after \nreliable anticoagulation for ___ weeks. She has not missed any \ndoses of anticoagulation since ___ after PEG tube placement. \n[ ] Required insulin after initiation of tube feeds. Continue to \nadjust or increase metformin and glipizide to obviate insulin \naltogether. \n[ ] On day of discharge, we learned patient's healthcare proxy \nconsidered changing code status to DNI, but she was not \navailable to confirm this.

The left kidney \nmeasures 11.1 cm. In the interpolar region of the right kidney, \nthere is a small 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm cystic-appearing lesion with \nthin mildly vascular internal septation. No associated internal \nnodularity. Cyst appears relatively unchanged compared to ___ CT. In the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a \nmildly lobulated avascular cystic-appearing lesion with possible \nperipheral septations. The lesion measures 2.1 x 3.4 x 2.24 cm \nand is overall unchanged in ___ compared to prior CT. In \nthe lower pole of the left kidney, there is a small cystic \nlesion measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm which also appears stable \ncompared to abdominal CT. In the bladder, there is a lobulated \nfilling defect noted to change morphology with patient motion. \nFilling defect likely represents debris, possibly due to blood \nclot particularly given patient's gross hematuria. Although \noccasional internal color doppler signal was noted, this was not \nconfirmed with pulsed Doppler evaluation and likely related to \nmotion artifact. The patient's Foley catheter was flushed during \nevaluation and frank blood clots were evacuated. Post-flush \nimaging demonstrated a compressed bladder with apparently \ndecreased filling defect. Given level of debris, the posterior \nbladder wall is not well seen and it would not be possible to \nexclude a mass in this region if this is of clinical concern.  \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Stable cystic lesions noted in the right upper pole, left \nupper pole and left lower pole of the kidneys.  \n2. Irregular filling defect in bladder likely represents blood \nclot.  \nPosterior bladder wall is not well evaluated due to the presence \nof this likely clot.  \n.  \nLower extremity ultrasound:  \nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left or \nright lower extremities.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with prostate cancer, CAD \nw\/mulitple stents, recent e. faecalis UTI, presenting with \nhematuria.  \n\n1.

We have imaged your brain and vessels with CT\/CTA and MRI which did not show evidence of an acute stroke. However, we did find evidence of 1 small subacute stroke (at least ___ weeks old) and very small older chronic strokes on the left side of your brain which are not the cause of your symptoms. We imaged your spinal cord at the level of your neck which showed chronic disc disease that abut the spinal cord. We believe your symptoms are coming from a mild impingement of one of the nerve roots coming from your neck, known as \"C7 RADICULOPATHY.\" This does not need to be treated with surgery, but you may benefit from outpatient occupational therapy. You should continue on your baby aspirin for stroke prevention. You may also wear a soft collar at night to help keep your neck in alignment. You can buy this from any pharmacy."}

Patient was able to void normally with \nPVRs < 50 cc without intervention. Workup for cause of abdominal \npain was unrevealing.\n\nACUTE ISSUES\n=============\n#Acute Abdominal Pain\nPatient reported severe lower abdominal pain which he stated was \nsimilar to his most recent admission during which he was treated \nfor a UTI. UA, however, revealed no evidence of infection. In \naddition, CT AP was performed which also did not reveal a cause \nfor the patient's pain. Recent CTA revealed no evidence of \nmesenterich ischemia. Recent EGD revealed a healing duodenal \nulcer for which the patient had been placed on BID PPI. He \nstated this pain was unlike his ulcer pain. He remained \nhemodynamically stable and pain was well-controlled with his \nhome regimen of oxycodone, PPI, and Carafate prior to discharge.\n\n#Urinary retention\nPatient reported suprapubic tenderness and had a temperature of \n100.2.

Repeat CT on ___ for this \ndeterioration did not reveal a bleed, so it is either completion \nof the stroke or edema. She also has a remote stroke in the R \nbasal ganglia on MRI, in a similar location. She was started on \nZocor and Lisinopril. Her FSBG were normal, no need for insulin \nor OADs. Stroke work-up included normal carotid ultrasonography \nand TTE. Etiology of the stroke was deemed to be secondary to \nsmall vessel disease.\n\nGiven her cachexia (family says it's habitual), her small \npericardial and pleural effusion and her stroke a pan-scan was \ndone (abd\/chest\/pelvis) revealing only a relatively thickened \nendometrium - this should be followed up on by hher \ngynaecologist, but is likely attributable to the HRT. \nEndometrial imaging by means of pelvic U\/S is recommnended. \n\nShe did not have any signficant in-house complications. Note \nthat her CT scan showed some aspiration of contrast in the \nlungs. Speech and swallow cleared her for thickened liquids and \npureed foods. Pills are crushed. \n\nShe was discharged in stable condition. Neurologic examination \nnotable for hypophonic, dysarthric, nonfluent speech, right \nhemiparesis.

Her PO \nantibiotics were d\/c'd and she was started on IV unasyn for \nenhanced gram negative and anaerobic coverage given the inner \nthigh\/groin area of the infection as well as daily \ndressing\/whick packing changes. With this intervention she \nrapidly improved with almost complete resolution of her \ncellulitis. Ultrasound was performed which did not show a \ndistinct, drainable fluid collection. Her deep wound swabs from \nthe prior admission grew coag negative staph which we have \nrequested further speciation and sensitivites. General surgery \nevaluated her infected site but did not find a drainable fluid \ncollection on exam. She was transitioned to PO augmentin \nin-house and watched overnight (because of her frequent \nre-admissions for this issue) and her cellulitis continued to \nimprove with spontaneous serosanginous and mild purulent \ndrainage from her incision site. She was discharged on a 14-day \ntotal course of PO augmentin 875mg PO BID and PO bactrim DS two \ntabs BID with close outpatient follow-up set up with her PCP and \ncontinued home daily ___ wound dressing\/whick packing changes \n(for which she is getting percocet to pre-medicate).  \n.\n# Microcytic Anema: New without evidence of bleeding. Crit \nstable. Iron and B12 studies wnl's. Likely harmless in a young, \notherwise healthy woman. Could be residual anemia of pregnancy \ns\/p C-section 6 weeks ago. Can pursue further workup as an \noutpatient.\n.\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES:\n.     \n# Hypothyroidism: Stable. TSH wnl's. Continued on home \nlevothyroxine 112mcg daily.\n.  \n# GERD: Stable. Kept on omeprazole 40mg daily (therapeutic \ninterchange for home nexium 40mg daily), as well as tums PRN.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1) Her wound swab speciation was pending at the time of \ndischarge.

The \nright heart was completely nonvisualized. The left atrium is \nmildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least \n15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is normal (LVEF = 65%). There is considerable \nbeat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection \nfraction due to an irregular rhythm. The aortic root is mildly \ndilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic \nvalve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial \neffusion.  \n\n___ Cardiovascular ECG: Atrial flutter with variable A-V \nconduction delay. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior \nfascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ \nthe rhythm is more clearly atrial flutter with variable block \ntoday, although I suspect that the prior ECG also represents \natrial flutter with 2:1 A-V conduction as it is more difficult \nto appreciate due to the more rapid rate. Clinical correlation \nis suggested. \n\n___BD & PELVIS W & W\/O: No central or \nperipheral DVT identified although examination is moderately \nlimited by body habitus and evaluation of the pelvis is also \nlimited by streak artifact from residual contrast in the \nbladder. \n\n___ Imaging CTA CHEST: \n1. Limited exam.  No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.  \nEvaluation of the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries \nis limited by respiratory motion. \n2. 4 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. \n3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes may be reactive.  \nCorrelate \nwith clinical symptoms \n\n___ Imaging UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No evidence of deep \nvenous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins.\n\n___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Suboptimal study due to \nunderpenetration presumed secondary to patient body habitus.  \nEnlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Possible underlying \nmediastinal lipomatosis.  Possible central pulmonary vascular \nengorgement.   \n\n___ Cardiovascular ECG: Probable sinus tachycardia. Right \nbundle-branch block. Possible prior inferior wall myocardial \ninfarction. No previous tracing available for comparison.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ year old male with past medical history of OSA, \nmorbid obesity admitted ___ w new atrial flutter, status \npost initiation and uptitration of rate control agents, started \non rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, seen by cardiology and \nrecommended for outpatient cardioversion, able to be discharged \nhome.  \n  \n# Atrial flutter: On admission, HR up to 130-140s. Refractory to \nmultiple metop IV pushes and PO 25 metop in ED. Negative trops \nx2. TSH WNL. ___, CTA negative for DVT despite elevated \nd-dimer.  No changes with carotid massage or vasalva, still \npersistent despite increasing doses of dilt.  TTE results as \naforementioned.  Patient eventually stabilized with dilt 240mg \nBID, metop succinate 200mg BID with HR in 80-90s and SBPs \n120-130s.  Patient was initially started on apixiban, then \nswitched to rivaroxaban given limited data of apixiban in obese \npatients.  Given high risk for anesthesia and TEE plus DCCV, it \nwas decided patient would undergo potential DCCV at a later \ndate.  In addition to the aforementioned recommendations, Atrius \ncardiology also recommended starting Lasix 20mg QD and aldactone \n25mg QD which patient tolerated well.\n\n# Acute diastolic CHF - Patient admitted with reports of \nworsening ___ edema. Patient underwent TTE and was seen by \n___ cardiology for above---they felt that this was most likely \nacute diastolic CHF and recommended initiation of Lasix and \naldactone.  Would consider rechecking electrolytes within 2 \nweeks of discharge.\n\n# OSA: Continued on CPAP at night. Counseled on importance of \nweight loss.  Met with nutritionist for further discussions of \nhealthy lifestyle changes to help risk reduction in heart \ndisease and modification of other risk factors.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- CTA Chest ___ showed: \"4 mm left upper lobe pulmonary \nnodule. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes may be \nreactive. Correlate with clinical symptoms.  RECOMMENDATION(S): \n Per ___ guidelines for ___ of pulmonary \nnodules, if no risk factors for\nmalignancy, no followup is recommended.  If risk factors, \nrecommend followup CT in ___ year.\"\n\n- QTc was ~ 460ms during this admission; would avoid Qtc \nprolonging agents if possible; can consider rechecking in the \nfuture \n\n- Please check Chem-10 at PCP ___ for ___ and K+ \nassessment since he has been started on diuretics; please also \ncheck INR (1.7 at discharge for unclear reasons)\n\n- Dr. ___ arrange to see this patient in ___ weeks \nfor ___ and to discuss cardioversion\n\n- Contact: ___, wife, ___  \n- Full Code\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The visualized portion of the orbits \nare \nunremarkable. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year-old lady with history of liver \ncirrhosis ___ alcohol use and Hepatitis C s\/p treatment, breast \ncancer in ___ in remission, depression, vertebral compression \nfractures presenting for worsening of chronic loss of \nappetite\/nausea\/vomiting\/diarrhea\/weight loss of unclear \netiology that has failed outpatient management. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#Chronic Diarrhea\n#Nausea\/Vomiting \n#Poor PO intake\n#Weight Loss\n#Failure to thrive \n#Severe protein calorie malnutrition\nPatient reported several months of diarrhea, which she said \nwould float at times. She states she has also lost over 20 \npounds since ___. Patient has also had chronic vomiting \nwhich has worsened over the last few weeks. She stated that it \nhad been occurring with liquids and solids, and it would occur \njust seconds to minutes after starting to eat. Does smoke \nmarijuana but not daily and vomiting not associated with use, \ncyclical vomiting less likely. Given her history of chronic \nalcohol use and mild epigastric tenderness, pancreatic \ndysfunction was thought to be a possibility. Her recent MRI \nliver and CT abdomen pelvis showed no signs of acute or chronic \npancreatitis, although this does not rule out exocrine \npancreatic insufficiency. Her EGD on ___ had normal biopsies \nand no structural abnormalities, but positive for H pylori. \nImaging and EGD with no abnormal masses, making \nGIST\/VIPoma\/Carcinoid tumor less likely. GI was consulted, \nrecommended the following studies. Stool studies showed negative \nO&P, culture. Elastase, calprotectin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin \nwere low but per GI not diagnostic of EPI given her very poor PO \nintake precding this. Stool K and Na suggested mixed \nsecretory\/osmotic diarrhea, which could also be in carbohydrate \nmalabsorption. Fecal fat was pending at time of discharge. \nVitamin D was normal, although she is on supplementation for \nosteoporosis. Anti-TTG IgA was not elevated and total IgA was \nnormal, so less likely Celiac. HIV antibodies were negative. TSH \nwas normal. CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology. She \nhad a colonoscopy on ___ which showed a few benign appearing \nsessile polyps which were biopsied. She had a gastric emptying \nstudy ___ which showed no evidence of gastroperisis. Her CRP \nwas mildly elevated at 47.5, making an acute flair of IBD less \nlikely. She also denied any bloody diarrhea or focal pain in the \nLLQ. She has a history of one oral lesion, which is most likely \nrelated to her dentures. From a nutrition standpoint, her \nprealbumin was low at 10, Zinc was low (likely falsely low in \nthe setting of high CRP) and Copper was normal. Her weight on \nadmission was 114, and she says her baseline a few months ago is \n140. Her weight on the day of discharge was 116. Nutrition \nconsulted. For management of her nausea, she was given Compazine \nfor nausea control prior to meals. Reglan was added standing in \naddition and she was able to tolerate good PO intake by day of \ndischarge, with discharge weight 116. Despite her history of \ndiarrhea, patient developed constipation during admission, \npossibly contributing to her nausea and abd pain, increased \nbowel reg and had BMs by day of discharge. She still endorsed \nnausea and ___ abd pain at discharge. She was treated for H \npylori gastritis as below. She should have outpatient breath \ntesting for H pylori eradication and SIBO breath testing with GI \nfor follow up.\n\n#H. pylori gastritis\nPatient had an EGD on ___ which demonstrated gastritis and \nbiopsy evidence of H. pylori. This could contribute to her \nnausea and vomiting and abdominal pain. Based on these findings, \nshe was initially recommended bismuth quadruple therapy. \nHowever, the patient reported an adverse effect of hearing loss \nsecondary to prior tetracycline use. Additionally, she reports a \nhistory of anaphylaxis to penicillin and sulfa drug use in the \npast. She was started on a two week course of triple therapy \nwith ___ with metronidazole 500mg TID, clarithromycin 500 BID, \nand pantoprazole 40mg BID (D1 of antibiotics ___. She was also \ninstructed to avoid NSAID use to prevent worsening of her \ngastritis, and her home celecoxib for back pain was \ndiscontinued. \n\n#Tachycardia \nPt had a persistently elevated heart rate throughout her \nadmission in the 100-120's. It would decrease slightly to fluid \nbolus or valvsalva maneuvers (120 -->105). EKGs showed no signs \nof atrial arrhythmia and appeared to be sinus tachycardia. \nTelemetry showed mostly sinus tachycardia with one short \npossible asymptomatic bout of SVT. She received electrolyte \nrepletion and no further arrhythmias were seen on telemetry. She \ndid not exhibit any infectious symptoms. Per her friend ___, she \nhas had a \"fast heart for years\". Pt denies prior cardiac \ndysfunction. Says she can feel her heart race sometimes, but \ndenies any chest pain. Outside records show her HR has \nfluctuated b\/w 80-110 on clinic visits. She should have a follow \nup EKG done at her next primary care appointment.\n\n#Headache\nPt had R-sided headache with photophobia and nausea on night of \n___. She described it as a ___ and denied it being the worst \nheadache of her life. Her neuro exam at that time was non-focal. \nThis was thought to be most consistent with a migraine. Her \nheadache resolved with Compazine and oxycodone. She had a head \nCT performed earlier in her admission (per above), which did not \nshow any obvious underlying causes of possible mass effect. Her \nneuro exam remained non-focal throughout her admission. She \ndenied a history of migraines, and possible triggers for this \nepisode could be her acute illness, new medication \n(metronidazole and clarithromycin although not common causes of \nmigraines). In terms of management if this recurs, she should \navoid NSAIDs due to her gastritis, and the patient states she \nhas an allergy to Tylenol, which she reports as an episode of \nacute severe pain after trying Tylenol. She can try caffeine in \nthe future and should follow up with her primary care if this \ncontinues to be an issue. \n\n#Rash\nOn ___, patient endorsed a new itchy rash. She had a 2cm \nerythematous, non raised, well circumscribed, non blanching, \nitch rash on the left nasloabial fold with very mild small \nacneiform papules on her cheeks. No signs of anaphylaxis and no \nrash seen on other areas of skin. Itchiness responded to \nBenadryl, and rash improved with topical steroids.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#Cirrhosis, likely compensated\nPatient has a history of cirrhosis, thought to be secondary to a \ncombination of chronic alcohol use and hepatitis C. The patient \nreports discontinuing alcohol since ___ and she has been \ntreated for her HCV in ___ (HCV genotype 3, treated with DAA \n___ with good response in reducing her viral load. \nHer most recent MRI of her liver and CT abdomen\/pelvis show no \nmention of ascites. Her most recent EGD on ___ was negative \nfor varices. She should continue to follow with her GI team.\n\n#Depression\n#Insomnia\n#Anxiety\nHer home Abilify, Venlafaxine, Mirtazapine, Lorazepam, and \nDiphenhydramine were continued throughout her admission.\n\n#Breast Cancer \nShe has a history of ER+\/PR+\/HER2- breast cancer which was \nresected in ___ and treated with hormonal risk reduction with \nanastrozole\/Lupron for ___ years. This was then complicated by \nosteoporosis and compression fractures in T4, T12, and L1 seen \nin ___. Her last breast MRI was in ___ which was unremarkable. \nShe should continue to follow with her oncologists and stay up \nto date with her breast cancer screening. \n\n#Chronic back pain from vertebral compression fractures\nPatient has a history of T4, T12, and L1 vertebral compression \nfractures thought to be secondary to hormonal risk reduction \ntherapy following resection of her breast cancer. She is written \nfor oxycodone ___ q6:prn as her home dose, although the patient \nstates she usually takes it ___ while home to manage pain. \nShe continued her home gabapentin during her stay. Her celcoxib \nwas discontinued, due to concern for possible worsening of her \ngastritis. She was also given lidocaine topical patches for pain \ncontrol.\n\n#HTN\nHer home amlodipine was continued throughout admission.\n\n#Asthma\nHer home albuterol inhaler was available to her but sparingly \nused throughout her admission.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================\nDischarge weight: 116 lbs\nDischarge QTC: 469\n\n[] F\/u colonoscopy biopsies and repeat colonoscopy in ___ years \npending biopsy results\n[] f\/u pending fecal fat studies\n[] Triple therapy for 2 week course through ___, then \ncontinue pantoprazole for at least 8 weeks for gastritis\n[] F\/u for H pylori eradication in 3 months\n[] Consider outpatient SIBO breath testing vs empiric rifaximin, \nhas GI follow up\n[] continue to monitor ECGs at outpatient follow up given many \nQTC prolonging meds.

The first bronchoscopy \nshowed severe tracheomalacia and very large trachea.  They were \nunable to place the non-metal stent because it was too small.  \nSo they repeated the bronchoscopy the following day under \nsedation and placed a metal stent in her left mainstem bronchus \nand another metal stent in the trachea.  The patient tolerated \nthe procedure well. She had mild cough with some sore throat \nafter the procedure.\n.  \n#. CAD: No chest pain here, no evidence of MI. We increased her \nbeta blocker from 25 to 50 po daily, continued her ACE and \nStatin.  We started Aspirin.  \n.\n#. Pump: EF reportedly 10% from OSH records. Echo here showed EF \n___.  We continued her home lasix.

Sclerotic lesions in the T11 vertebral body as well as the \nmanubrium on the left.  8 mm the right upper lobe pulmonary \nopacity. 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Moderate \nmediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement.  These findings \nare concerning for possible malignancy. Given the sclerotic \nnature of the bony lesions, occult lung or breast malignancy or \nlymphoma should be considered. Alternatively the central lymph \nnode enlargement can be seen in sarcoidosis or possibly \nlymphoma. \n3. Bilateral adrenal thickening, indeterminate but no focal \nlesions; most \nlikely hyperplasia. \n\nCT Head noncontrast ___\nIMPRESSION:  \nThe previously seen AVM is grossly similar in size compared to \n___. Since this scan was done recently after a CTA of the \nchest, residual IV contrast is seen within the head, and a small \nhemorrhage cannot accordingly be ruled out. No evidence of new \nmass effect or midline shift. \n\nECHO ___\nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is mild to moderately dilated. No atrial septal \ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right \natrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global \nsystolic function (LVEF>65%). Due to suboptimal technical \nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully \nexcluded. The right ventricular cavity appears dilated with \nnormal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) \nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is \nno aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. There is an anterior space which most likely \nrepresents a prominent fat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global \nsystolic function. Right ventricular cavity mildly dilated with \nnormal systolic function. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ \nthe right ventricle now appears dilated in the subcostal views \n(not well seen in the apical views). Other findings are similar. \n  \n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n___ 06:35AM BLOOD WBC-8.6 RBC-4.38 Hgb-13.2 Hct-42.8 MCV-98 \nMCH-30.1 MCHC-30.8* RDW-14.2 Plt ___\n___ 05:56AM BLOOD Neuts-57.0 ___ Monos-8.0 \nEos-12.8* Baso-0.6\n___ 06:35AM BLOOD Glucose-90 UreaN-20 Creat-0.9 Na-138 \nK-5.2* Cl-98 HCO3-37* AnGap-8\n___ 06:35AM BLOOD Glucose-89 UreaN-20 Creat-1.0 Na-139 \nK-4.9 Cl-98 HCO3-36* AnGap-10\n___ 06:35AM BLOOD Calcium-8.5 Phos-4.1 Mg-2.1\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ y\/o F with PMHx significant for multiple \nAVM and a seizure disorder who presented with hypoxia and AMS, \ntriggered on floor for continued hypoxia and lethargy.  \n\n# AECOPD and ACUTE DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  Patient presented \nwith acute hypoxia, confusion.  The etiology of her hypoxia was \nthought to be multifactorial.  The elevated BNP on presentation \nwas concerning for heart failure and pulmonary edema. She was \ndiuresed with small lasix bolus in the ED and did show some \nimprovement in oxygenation.  Her heavy smoking history, evidence \nof chronic bronchitis and emphsyematous changes on CT, lack of \nsignificant pulmonary consolidation, wheezing and hypercarbia \nwere concerning for obstructive lung process leading to CO2 \nretention and hypoxia.  Her body habitus and witnessed apneic \nevents (both central and obstructive) are concerning for both \nsleep apnea.  She was ruled out for PE by CTA.  As she was \ndiuresed and received BiPAP her oxygenation and mental status \nimproved. She was able to be weaned off to a Venturi mask with \nFiO2 of 50%. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations as well as \na 5 day course of azythromycin and prednisone were started for a \nCOPD exacerbation.  Her oxygen requirements continued to \ndecrease without further diuresis until she was on nasal \ncannula.  She was then called out to the floor where she was \ncontinued on oxygen but noted clinical and subjective \nimprovement in respiratory status. She was evaluated by physical \ntherapy who felt that she would benefit from ___ rehab for \noxygen teaching and gait training in setting of using home O2.\n\n# PULMONARY NODULES AND MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY AND BONE \nLESIONS:Concerning for a malignancy with metastatic disease.  \nDifferential includes lung primary vs. lymphoma vs. metastatic \ndisease from another site such as breast.  Patient was informed \nof the findings. Her LDH was normal, and reported no B-symptoms. \nHer heavy smoking history puts her at increased risk of lung \ncancer but also other malignancies.  She reports that her \ncolonoscopy was up to date but that she has not had a mammogram \nin many years.  She underwent transbronchial biopsy of hula \nlymph node, which returned negative for malignant cells. She has \noutpatient follow-up with Pulmonary at which time a decision \nwill need to be made about the need for further imaging or \ntissues sampling.\n\n# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Creatinine elevated to 1.3 on \npresentation compared to baseline of 1.0 less than a year prior. \n She may have pre-renal azotemia due to HF or medication side \neffect (recent initiation of lisinopril)  Patient was diuresed \nand lisinopril was held.  Her creatinine returned to baseline of \n0.9-1.0.\n\n# HYPERTENSION:  Not well controlled on presentation.  ACEI held \non presentation given her hyperkalemia and ___.  She was started \non Amlodipine 5mg daily and uptitrated to 10mg daily with good \nresponse.\n\n# COMPLEX SEIZURE DISORDER:  Patient on admission had her \nmedications with her, which were further confirmed with her \noutpatient Neurologist.  She had a phenytoin level on admission \nthat was low but her outpatient Neurologist recommended no \nadjustments to her current medication regimen.  She continued \nher home medications and had no evidence of seizure this \nadmission. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Outpatient Dermatology evaluation for pruritis.\n- F\/U flow cytometry to rule out T cell lymphoma and \nhistiocytosis.\n- Evaluate volume status restart Lasix PRN.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

STEMI: Pt presented with an anterior STEMI.  Her TIMI risk \nscore was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new \nor recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent \nrevascularization.  Her SVG found to be completely occluded and \na BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.

She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide \nfor 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril, \nand atorvastatin.  Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately \nwith peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2.  There was concern for \nacute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement.  \nHowever, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no \nsignificant pulmonary edema (see below).  ECHO showed moderate \nto severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with \nanterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior\/inferolateral \nhypokinesis.  Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for \nventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly \ndiscontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit. \n\n# Hypoxia:  Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing \nsaturations in low ___ on 6L from baseline 92% on RA.  CXR \nshowed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on \nceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.  As the patient had \nhistory recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which \nshowed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new \ndiffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for \nadenocarcinoma.  Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination \nof postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from \nadenocarcinoma.  Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, \nlevofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course.  \nRepeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower \nlobe infiltrate.

CT scan on admission showed multifocal pneumonia. The \ndifferential for the patient's presentation included EGPA vs AEP \nvs Vaping related lung disease, with less likely APBA or \nCoccidioides. The patient was also noted to have a significant \nperipheral eosinophilia. She was initially started on \nCeftraixone\/azithromycin for treatment of CAP.  Which was \ntransitioned to Vancomycin when sputum from BAL was +for MRSA- \nshe was ultimately transitioned to clindamycin to complete a 5 \nday course of antibiotics. Following bronchoscopy, the patient \nwas started on Prednisone 60mg daily, She had a CT sinus which \ndid not show evidence of EGPA. She was also evaluated by \ndermatology who found no skin lesions to biopsy.  Ultimately, \nthe patient's ANCA (PR3 antibodies) returned positive. In \naddition she was found to have a significantly elevated IgE. The \ncombination of ANCA positivity, eosinophilia, lung findings are \nconsistent with EGPA. The patient was discharged on Prednisone \n40mg daily to continue until close pulmonary follow up. She was \ncontinued on a PPI and started on atovaquone for PJP ppx.  She \nwas also started on Advair. ECG was without significant \nabnormalities. The patient will need an echocardiogram as an \noutpatient to asses for cardiac involvement of EGPA. The patient \nhad significant improvement in her symptoms prior to discharge.\n\n#Hypertension\nThe patient was noted to have significantly elevated blood \npressures. She was started on HCTZ which was uptitrated to 50mg \nDaily and then amiodarone was added. Blood pressures not \noptimally controlled on discharge. Will likely require \nadditional titration \n\n#Vulvovaginal candidiasis:\n- Patient was given Fluconazole x2\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n#DVT\/PE: on xarelto at home, no PE seen on CTA\n-continued home Xarelto 20 QD\n\n#Tobacco use: \nThe patient was counseled on smoking cessation. She expressed \ninterest in Chantix and was provided a prescription on \ndischarge.\n\n#Mood disorder:\nThe patient was continued on her home medications while \nhospitalized. She has follow up scheduled with her psychiatrist \nthe week after discharge.\n\nTransitional issues:\n- Please arrange outpatient echocardiogram\n- Continue to monitor blood pressure, may require additional \nmedications\n- Discharged on Chantix for smoking cessation- Would continue to \nencourage smoking cessation\n- Patient has follow up scheduled with pulmonary, can consider \nreferral to rheumatology as outpatient\n\nCode: Full\nPatient seen and examined on day of discharge. >30 minutes on \ndischarge activities. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Exam notable for bibasilar \ncrackles and ronchi; 3+ pitting edema also noted.  CXR was \nobtained showing multifocal patchy infiltrates c\/w pneumonia or \nradiation pneumonitis.  He was sent to ___ clinic and was \nadmitted. \n \nPast Medical History:\nPAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY\n-___: atypical chest pain around time of hip replacement\n-___: admitted to ___ and \nruled\nout for myocardial infarction.  He underwent a left heart\ncatheterization, which did not show active ischemic disease. \n-___: persistent atypical chest pain, Imdur increased\n-___: CT abdomen and pelvis for monitoring of his endovascular\nAAA repair, with noncontributory findings, including a small\nindirect hernia, colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis,\nand subpleural honeycombing at the lung bases, suggestive of\npulmonary fibrosis.  \n-___: Chest x-ray with a left upper lobe nodularity. This\nprompted immediate CT scan of the chest without contrast given\nhis CKD, which demonstrated a soft tissue lesion probably \narising\nfrom the second left costosternal joint, which is 5.6 x 3.8 cm. \nOf note, a 1.6 x 2.9 cm lesion had been visualized at the same\nlocation back in ___.  The lesion, at this point, had\npartially invaded the left chest wall with erosion of the left\naspect of the sternal manubrium.  The lesion was felt to be\nsuspicious for malignant process, either originating from the\ncartilage such as chondrosarcoma or from the anterior \nmediastinum\nor from the lung.  There was also the new appearance of upper\nlobe nodules ranging from 3-14 mm, as well as numerous\nmediastinal lymph nodes, the largest at the right lower\nparatracheal station measuring 1 cm, which were felt to be \nstable\nsince ___, referred to Dr. ___ of thoracic surgery,\nrecommended core biopsy as well as an MRI to further \ncharacterize\nthe lesion.  The MRI notes that there is a 5.6 x 3.8 cm mass\narising adjacent to the second left costosternal joint,\ncorresponding to the finding of the ___ CT scan.  The\nlesion extends both anterior and posterior to the rib, extending\ninto the anterior mediastinum.  The lesion is homogeneously\nisointense to muscle on T1-weighted images and relatively low\nsignal, but somewhat heterogeneous on T2-weighted images.  Of\nnote, the lesion does not appear to arise from the chondral\nportion of the rib.  The mass appears to displace the great\nvessels posteriorly to a small degree, but does not appear to\ninvolve these vessels.  There is no perfused soft tissue edema\nadjacent to the mass to suggest an acute inflammatory process.\n-___ biopsy of the mass, which demonstrated squamous \ncell\ncarcinoma, moderately differentiated, nonkeratinizing.

He had recent hospital visits for radiation \ntherapy, so his abx treatment was initially IV vancomycin + \ncefepime to ensure coverage for HCAP. CT chest scan findings \nwere consistent with infection as well. There was initially a \nconcern for possible radiation pneumonitis given he had \nundergone XRT, but per radiation oncology attending's review, \nthe likelihood of radiation pneumonitis was low given the time \ncourse and discrepancy in new pulmonary findings compared to the \nfield of prior radiation therapy received. Blood and sputum \nculture results were negative and his abx therapy was eventually \nnarrowed to po levofloxacin for an 8-day total abx course. His \ncough progressively decreased during his admission and his \nrespiratory status improved. Pt also benefitted from receiveing \ngauifenesin, ipratroprium nebs and incentive spirometry. \nAlthough his respiratory status had improved compared to \nadmission, on day of discharge pt still had supplemental oxygen \nrequirement based on ambulatory O2 sat testing which showed \n83-85% O2 on room air with ambulation.\n\n#CHF exacerbation\nIn addition to PNA, pt presented with volume overload likely due \nto acute CHF exacerbation in the s\/o infection. He was diuresed \nwith IV lasix and his respiratory status improved from high ___ \nO2 sat on supplemental oxygen to high ___ sat on 3L nasal \ncannula. His volume status improved and he was transitioned to \nhis home regimen of 40mg po lasix daily, on which he was \nautodiuresing well by time of discharge. \n\n#RLE DVT\nDVT was discovered in the right leg on ultrasound and pt was \ninitially started on heparin gtt. He was subsequently \ntransitioned to renally dosed once a day dosing of lovenox. \nFactor Xa level was checked to ensure therapeutic range and pt \nwas discharged on 120mg lovenox qd.\n\n#___ lung cancer\nPt received a CT chest which was reviewd by his primary \noncologist Dr. ___. Per primary oncologist's \ninterpretation, CT did not show interval disease progression in \nhis lungs and may have actually showed some improvement. He will \nfollow up with oncology as an outpatient.\n\n#Chronic back pain\nPt has chronic back pain that has been worsened with frequent \ncoughing. An MRI was obtained out of concern for lumbar \nvertebral metastases, but MRI showed no definite evidence of \nbony mets in the spine. He was started on baclofen and symptoms \nseemed to improve. He was able to ambulate with ___ on his walker \nand able to transfer from bed to chair and bathroom well.\n\n====================\nTransitional Issues:\n====================\n-Pt was treated with 8 day course of abx. Last day of \nlevofloxacin is ___. Please ensure completion of therapy.\n-Pt was volume overloaded on admission and diuresed with IV \nlasix which improved his respiratory status. He was transitioned \nback to his home regimen of 40mg po lasix and autodiuresing well \nat discharge. Recommend monitoring his volume status.\n-Pt's repiratory status improved compared to admission, but \nambulatory O2 saturation was 82-84% on room air on day of \ndischarge and >97% on 2L nasal cannula. Recommend continued \nassessmnet for weaning down oxygen requirement.\n-RLE DVT was discovered on ultrasound. Pt was started on lovenox \n(1.5mg\/kg daily, confirmed with pharmacy to be appropriate for \nhis GFR). Factor Xa was checked and showed therapeutic range. \nHis home cilostazol had been discontinued.\n-The patient was started on Baclofen for lumbar back pain\n-The patient received 1u pRBC transfusion for anemia, which was \nfollowed by 40 mg IV lasix. Given his systolic dysfunction, \nconsider chasing future pRBC transfusions with IV lasix to \nprevent volume overload.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Oxygen saturation \nfound to be 78% after 500cc fluid and decitabine infusion. \nPlaced on nasal cannula at 3L. Given 20mg IV Lasix without \nimprovement in oxygenation and CTA negative for PE but \nsignificant for worsening pleural effusion and compression \natelectasis. TTE with moderate pulmonary HTN but good systolic \nfunction despite elevated BNP. Troponin negative. No evidence of \ninfection. Pulmonary consulted and felt most likely driver is \neffusion and atelectasis on substrate of COPD. CT Scan without \ncontrast on ___ showed ground glass opacities and evidence of \neither pulmonary edema versus possible PCP PNA, though edema \nfelt to be more likely. Chemical injury, infection, microembolic \ndisease, and leukostasis all thought to be less likely. \nBeta-D-glucan positive on ___, but PCP on bronchoscopy was \nnegative. Bronchoscopy showed negative viral panel and culture \nwith commensal flora on culture. \n\nShe underwent daily diuresis with 20mg IV Lasix with good urine \noutput. She was also encouraged to frequently use incentive \nspirometer. On ___ her ambulatory oxygen saturation was 92-95% \nand her oxygen was discontinued. Presumed cause of her hypoxia \nis pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Although a TTE showed normal \nsystolic function, it is possible that she has diastolic \ndysfunction that contributed to her volume overload. \n\n#Myeloproliferative disorder\/MDS: \n#Elevated uric aicd\n#Massive splenomegaly with splenic infarct\nPresented on day 2 of cycle 1 of decitabine.

Had bone marrow biopsy during recent admission \nshowed known MPN with myelofibrosis with increased blasts of 7% \n(myeloid sequencing panel has shown mutations associated with \nMPN and MDS). She received three days of 2g of hydrea followed \nby two days of 1g of hydrea and her white blood count decresed \nfrom over 90 to 5.5. Hydrea was then discontinued in order to \nprevent caused significant cytopenia. \n\nShe also has recently chronically high uric acid and received \nrasburicase during last admission due to allopurinol and \nfubuxostat allergies. She received rasburicase twice during this \nadmission for a uric acid greater than 10. \n\nHer splenic pain from massive splenomegaly and likely splenic \ninfarcts significantly worsened early in the admission requiring \nq6 oxycodone. However it spontaneously improved and by discharge \nshe did not need any pain medication.

She was started \non ciprofloxacin empirically, but this was switched to \nvancomycin IV when cultures grew out enterococcus.  \nSensitivities were pending when pt left hospital so a PICC was \nplaced and pt was continued on IV vancomycin as an outpatient \nwith plans to follow up with the ___ clinic in ___ days \nregarding the culture sensitivities.\n\n# urinary retention: pt experience urinary retention in the \nhospital, requiring catheterization. Pt was advised to perform \nstraight catheterization every morning and given the information \nto follow up with a urologist to further evaluate this issue.\n\n# Diabetes mellitus type 1 w\/ Hyperglycemia: Pt's diabetes was \npoorly controlled upon admission, with recent blood sugars \nranging up to the 500s per patient, and most recent HbA1C of \n11.2 in ___. Pt was in the process of initiating an insulin \npump through ___ clinic.  Pt was continued on her home \nregimen of lantus 40mg qAM and 30mg qPM as well as a sliding \nscale insulin dose while in house.  Pt experienced wide \nfluctuations in blood glucose levels over the course of her \nvisit, in one day ranging from ___ to low 300s, so her morning \nlantus dose was decreased to 36 units subcutaneously every AM.  \nPt will follow up with ___ clinic regarding possibility of \ninsulin pump to better manage her blood sugar.\n\n# SOB: Suspicion was low for ACS, as pt had no ECG changes and \nCE negative x1. CXR was unremarkable, and pt denied shortness of \nbreath by hospital day 2, so no further work up was pursued.  \nThought to be secondary to underlying anemia and dehydration.\n\n# Word finding difficulty: pt has had similar episodes in past \nand had complete neuro work up, including MRI which was normal. \nAdditionally, INR was supratherapeutic at 3.1 so suspicion for \nTIA was low. It was considered that pt simply had trouble \nfinding words because of dizziness and hypotension. no further \naction was taken at this time.\n\n# H\/o PE\/anti-phospholipid Ab syndrome): INR was 3.1 on \nadmission, so coumadin dose was held x 1 and resumed the next \nday, alternating 2mg w\/ 3mg daily.  She will follow up to have \nher INR checked within one week.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine\n\n# CAD: continued aspirin, metoprolol and atorvastatin\n\n# PVD: did not have cilostazol in house, so this was held and \nresumed on discharge.\n\n# Depression: continued desipramine, duloxetine, trazodone and \nlorazepam PRN\n\n# GERD: continued PPI\n\n# Insomnia: continued zolpidem\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n\n# follow up urine culture results with ___ clinic in ___ days, \nand adjust antibiotics accordingly\n# follow up with urologist to evaluate urinary retention\n# follow up INR checks to ensure coumadin therapeutic\n# follow up with ___ clinic re: insulin pump\n \nMedications on Admission:\nALLOPURINOL - 200mg daily\nATORVASTATIN - 80 mg qpm\nCALCITRIOL - 0.25 mcg daily\nCILOSTAZOL - 100 mg BID\nDESIPRAMINE - 50 mg daily\nDULOXETINE [CYMBALTA] - 90 mg daily\nESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [NEXIUM] - 40 mg BID\nGABAPENTIN - 600 mg BID\nHYDROCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN - 7.5 mg-750 mg q4H PRN pain - has not \ntaken in 3 months\nINSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] - 40 units in am 30 units QPM\nINSULIN LISPRO [HUMALOG] - sliding scale\nLEVOTHYROXINE - 137 mcg daily\nLORAZEPAM - 0.5 mg TID PRN anxiety\nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE - 25 mg qPM\nMYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL - 500 mg BID\nNIFEDIPINE - 30 mg daily\nNITROGLYCERIN [NITROSTAT] - 0.4 mg SL PRN chest pain\nPREDNISONE - 7.5 mg daily\nPROMETHAZINE - 25 mg Suppository PRN vomitting\nPROMETHAZINE [PHENERGAN] - 25 mg BID PRN vomitting\nTACROLIMUS - 1.5mg qAM and 1mg qPM\nTRAZODONE - 50 mg daily\nVALSARTAN [DIOVAN] - 40 mg daily\nWARFARIN - 3 mg alternating with 2mg daily\nZOLPIDEM [AMBIEN] - 10 mg daily\nASPIRIN - 81 mg daily\nCALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3 600 mg\/400 units BID\nOMEGA 3-DHA-EPA-FISH OIL [OMEGA 3 FISH OIL] - 1800mg BID\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. allopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n2. atorvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at \nbedtime).  \n3. calcitriol 0.25 mcg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n4. desipramine 25 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n5. duloxetine 30 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Selective coronary angiography \nof this right dominant system revealed one vessel CAD. The LMCA \nwas patent. The LAD was patent, but with slow flow suggestive of \nmicrovascular dysfunction and tortuous terminal vessels. The LCX \nwas patent but with slow flow and tortuous terminal vessels. \nThere was a single large OM2 and a modest LPL\/OM5. The RCA had a \nshort horizontal origin with early upward shepherd's crook bend. \nThe distal RCA was diffusely small in caliber (suggestive of a \nspontaneous arterial dissection with a secondary hematoma \ncompressing the lumen), with up to 75% narrowing extending to \nhazy filling defect at origin of RPDA\/bifurcation with small \ndistal AV groove RCA. There was a tortuous hairpin turn in the \nmid RPDA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly \nelevated LVEDP of 15 mmHg and normal systemic arterial \npressures. There was no transaortic gradient on catheter \npullback from LV to aorta. 3. Left ventriculography demonstrated \nglobal hypokinesis, worse inferiorly and inferoapically. The \ncalculated LVEF was 47%. There was no non-ectopic mitral \nregurgitation. 4. Successful PTCA and placement of bare-metal \nstents in the RCA were performed. The procedure was complicated \nby proximal-mid RCA dissection. Overlapping bare-metal stents \nwere placed in the RCA (proximal-to-distal), with 4.0x12 mm \nVision, 3.5x18 mm Driver, 3.0x30 mm Driver, 3.0x30 mm Driver, \n2.5x24 mm Micro Driver, 2.5x8 mm Micro Driver, and 2.25x24 mm \nMicro Driver.  Final angiography showed TIMI 2 flow in the RCA, \nslightly slow flow in the jailed AM branches, no residual \nstenoses in the stents, a slight amount of contrast staining \noutside of the proximal stents due to the dissection, and a mild \n(grade B) dissection in the proximal RPDA (See ___ Comments). \n5. Limited angiography of the right femoral artery showed the \narteriotomy puncture site in the body of the right common \nfemoral artery.  There was a corrugated appearance of the common \nfemoral artery and the superficial femoral artery that was \nsuggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia.  A 6 ___ Angioseal VIP \nwas deployed successfully with good hemostasis. 6. Monitoring \nfor radiation-induced skin injury is recommended given nominal \nIRP fluoroscopic skin exposure >4 Gy. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One \nvessel coronary artery disease, possibly due to spontaneous \narterial dissection. \n2. Mild diffuse, heterogeneous left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction. 3. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 4. \nPlacement of bare-metal stents in the distal RCA. 5. PCI \ncomplicated by proximal-mid RCA dissection that was successfully \nrescued by placement of additional bare metal stents. 6. \nPossible fibromuscular dysplasia, based on the angiographic \nappearance of the right CFA and SFA. 7. Successful Angioseal \nclosure of the right femoral arteriotomy. 8. Monitoring for \nradiation-induced skin injury is recommended given nominal IRP \nfluoroscopic skin exposure >4 Gy. \n.\nTTE (Complete) Done ___ at 8:25:18 AM The left atrium is \nmildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. \nThe left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary \nto hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. There is no \nventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and \nfree wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no \naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally \nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  \n.\nINITIAL ECG: NSR @58, LAD, Q in III, biphasic TW in V3-V5\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo female with history of gastric bypass surgery\/obesity \npresented with chest pain and found to have NSTEMI + RCA lesion. \nNo history of coagulopathy.

Found to have asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n\n- CORONARIES: LMCA clean. LAD with DES. Cx\/OM with DES. Diagonal \n50-60% stenosis. LPL branch with mid\/distal 60% stenosis. \n- PUMP: normal EF \n- RHYTHM: sinus \n\n# Angina: patient with chest pain occurring at rest, multiple \ntimes, relieved by nitroglycerin, concerning for unstable angina \n(ACS). No chest pain in over 24 hours at this time. She did have \nevidence of troponin leak with troponin 0.10, which is above \nbaseline for similar renal function. Her troponins downtrended \nand stabilized. She recently had PCI to LAD and Cx\/OM with DES, \non warfarin, aspirin and Plavix. Cardiac catheterization at the \ntime showed evidence of multi-vessel CAD, but patient preferred \nmultiple PCIs over CABG. DDx: microvascular disease vs. \nrestenosis of stent vs. progressive stenosis due to CAD. Given \nrecent onset of symptoms following stent placement and results \nof recent catheterization, most likely diagnosis is angina from \nmicrovascular disease, likely secondary to T1DM. Catheterization \nwas initially deferred given unlikely active ACS based on recent \ncath images. An attempt was made to start her on isosorbide \ndinitrate for angina but patient did not tolerate secondary to \nhypotension and confusion (see below). Her anginal symptoms were \ntreated with Ranolazine instead. She was continued on aspirin \nand Plavix, warfarin (one dose held given initial possible \ncath), statin, and metoprolol. Patient having some trouble not \nvomiting up pills at home, but was counseled on importance of \nfocusing on ASA\/Plavix and anti-rejection meds. \n\n#UTI, Bacteriuria: Noted to have bactiuria in urinalysis on ___ \nbut asymptomatic. However, because patient has renal transplant, \nmust be treated even for asymptomatic bacteriuria. She also had \nrecent UTI but likely did not receive full tx course given \nvomiting pills at home. Started on ceftriaxone instead of cipro \ngiven concern for long qt on EKG on ___ (QTc 471). Recently \ntreated for UTI with cipro, but couldn't complete treatment \ncourse because of nausea\/vomiting likely secondary to \ngastroparesis. She received 1 dose fosfomycin prior to \ndischarge. Urine culture is pending. \n\n# Hypertension: SBP in 180s noted but was not symptomatic. Plan \nis to medically manage blood pressure in a way that does not \ncause hypotensive symptoms. Goal for renal transplant is BP < \n140\/80 unless there is significant proteinuria, in which case \ngoal is 130\/80. Urinalysis on ___ shows some proteinuria, so \n___ consider protein:Cr ratio in outpatient setting. She was \ncontinued on amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily, losartan 50mg PO daily, \nand home metoprolol (see below). \n\n# ESRD s\/p LRRT complicated by CKD, likely secondary to diabetic \nnephropathy: baseline Cr is approximately 1.3-1.5, no signs of \ncurrent problem with her graft. She was continued on tacrolimus \n1mg PO q12hrs, prednisone 5mg PO daily, MMF 500mg PO BID, \nBactrim ppx and calcitriol \n\n# Hypotension, lethargy, confusion: afternoon of ___, after \nreceiving isosorbide dinitrate, patient had relative \nhypotension, lethargy, and confusion while eating lunch. FSG \ninitially 133 but continued to decrease to 58. Lay down and \nreceived 1L IVF and started to feel better but then had \nrecurrence 30 minutes later and was found to have low BS and \nstable BP ~105. Subsequently had BP to high ___. Suspected \nreaction to long-acting nitrate and insulin. Non-contrast head \nCT on ___ normal. Isosorbide dinitrate was discontinued and \ndecreased Metop back to home dose (had attempted to increase to \n25 BID). She was given 2.5L IV fluids. Decreased insulin to \n___ recs from previous admissions; her insulin should be \ntitrated as an outpatient. \n\n# DM1: Hgb A1C 9.3% (___). patient was managed on glargine \nand Humalog sliding scale. Her home sliding scale is \n(BG-130)\/17. Initially started on Glargine 36U QAM and 16U QPM, \nwhich was decreased to 26qAM & 10qHS after hypoglycemic episode. \nShe was continued on promethazine for nausea as well as \nduloxetine, gabapentin and lidocaine patches for diabetic \nneuropathy. She should have outpatient titration of insulin \n\n# Gastroparesis: Pt with vomiting with solid foods x 10 days. \nHas no trouble with PO liquids. She was noted to have long QT \n(471 on ___ that later improved, but Zofran was avoided. \n\n# History of PE, APLAS: continue warfarin, goal INR ___. \nRestarted warfarin (had been held in anticipation of Cath) \n\n# PAD: continued home cilostazol. \n\n# Anemia: At recent baseline, but previously 13 >6mo ago\n\n# GERD: continued ranitidine.

In reviewing your imaging from your images from your angiography last month, it is unlikely that you are having coronary disease that would require re-catheterization. We started you on a long-acting nitrate (isosorbide dinitrate) to help with your symptoms, however this caused an unsafe drop in your blood pressure. Although this blood pressure drop was likely exacerbated by your recent dehydration from vomiting, you should let future providers know about this episode if you are prescribed it again. We also recommend that you monitor your blood pressure at home. Because you were unable to tolerate the isosorbide, we started you on a different medication, ranolazine, to help with your chest pain. It is really important that you continue to take your aspirin and Plavix as well as your immunosuppressants."}

Although this could represent volume loss in the \nright lower lobe with associated pleural effusion, in the \nappropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have \nto be considered.  Probable atelectatic changes at the left \nbase. \n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging \nsuggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not \nbe estimated. There is a small circumferential pericardial \neffusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global \nbiventricular systolic function. Small circumferential \npericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence for \nhemodynamic compromise.\n\n___ CXR\nIMPRESSION:  \nHeart size and mediastinum are stable.  Right PICC line tip \nterminates at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and \nmediastinum are stable.  Tracheostomy is in unchanged position.  \nNo interval development of of new consolidations is seen except \nfor persistent right basal opacity which most likely represents \na combination of atelectasis and infection.

Now presents with multiple episodes of \nunresponsiveness, and right then leftward eye deviation. \nAssociated hypotension improved with lorazepam, and \ndocumentation also indicates that she became more responsive, \nwith eyes open, following simple commands, prior to becoming \nunresponsive again. Per Neurology consult, these episodes are \nconcerning for complex partial seizures, vs non-convulsive \nstatus epilepticus. Ultimately, etiology was unclear, though she \nhas two known infections being treated with cefepime, including \nUTI and PNA. CT head unremarkable. EEG was performed which \nshowed no epileptiform activity. She was switched to ceftazidime \nfor antibiotic coverage out of concern for altered mental \nstatus\/seizures from cefepime. However, given the lack of \ncorrelate on EEG and the alternate explanation (ie respiratory \ndistress due to mucous plugging), it is likely that her episodes \nboth prior to and during admission were NOT seizures. She was \ncontinued on levetiracetam 750mg PO BID. \n\n# ECG changes and troponin elevation: Patient with history of \nrecent NSTEMI, managed medically. On this admission, she had \nfluctuating EKG changes including intermittent PR depressions, \nand ___ ST segment changes, which appear most \nconsistent with J-point elevation. Cardiology was consulted, who \nrecommended TTE and trending of cardiac markers. She was found \nto have preserved EF with small pericardial effusion and EKGs \nc\/w pericarditis. No further treatment was recommended as the \ndiffuse ECG changes were transient and not associated with a \nparticular coronary distribution. Her troponins trended downward \nand she had no complaints of chest pain. She was continued on \nASA, high-dose atorvastatin and metoprolol.\n\n# Ventilator-associated pneumonia: Diagnosed during last \nadmission with leukocytosis, fever, RLL infiltrate, treated with \ncefepime for planned 15 day course, to end ___. CXR at ___ \n___ shows mild persistent RLL infiltrate. She is having \nminimal tracheal secretions now, mild leukocytosis, and no \nreported fevers or hypoxemia on 30% FIO2. ___ not need to \ncomplete full 15 day treatment\n\n# Acute hypoxic respiratory distress: Her hospital course was \nnotable for acute hypoxemic event due to mucous plugging. On \n___, the patient became acutely hypoxic down into the 40's \nfollowing a change in position. She was taken off the ventilator \nand bad masked given coinciding decreases in tidal volume. \nEmergent bronchoscopy was performed which revealed severe mucus \nplugging worse in the RLL. This plugging was relieved and \npatient's oxygen saturations came back up to high 90's. During \nthis episode was observed to have extensor posturing and roving \neye movements, however neurology evaluated clinical findings \nalong with EEG and determined that they were not seizures. \nDuring the event patient was hypertensive with SBP up to 240's, \nfentanyl and versed bolus for sedation was given, as well as 10 \nmg IV labetalol. Pressures continued to be elevated throughout \nthe afternoon and metoprolol was doubled from 6.25 Q6 to 12.5 \nQ6. To assist with the clearance of her secretions, she was \nplaced on the Mechanical Insufflator Exsufflator machine, which \nsignificantly assisted improved her cough. She should use this \nevery eight hours and also as needed.\n\n# Chronic respiratory failure: Mechanically ventilated, does not \nrequire sedation. She was continued on prior vent settings: CMV, \nTV 350, RR 20, FIO2 30% but with an increase in PEEP from 5 to \n8.\n\n# Diabetes mellitus: continued home lantus and insulin sliding \nscale.\n\n# HTN: was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6hrs. Would \nrecommend continued monitoring of BP and titration of regimen at \nfacility.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=====================\n- Please use MIE every eight hours and as needed for cough\n- Please continue ceftazidime through ___ (treating ventilator \nassociated pneumonia from previous admission)\n- Please continue to monitor her BP and titrate regimen as \nnecessary.\n# Communication: HCP:  Legal Guardian ___: \n___\n# Code: Full, per legal guardian\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The Neurologists evaluated you and discovered that you are not having any seizures. You can continue the same Keppra as before. We also asked the Cardiologists to see you because of your history of a recent heart attack and some changes on your EKG. They felt that you were not having a new heart issue and did not recommend any new treatment. During your hospital stay, you had a brief episode of getting some mucous and sputum caught in your airway that caused you to lose consciousness. We were able to suck the mucous out with a bronchoscopy. From now, we recommend that you something called the MIE or Cough Assist to help you bring up secretions so as to prevent this from happening again. We are discharging you back to your facility where they can finish your antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and provide you with the Cough Assist as well."}

Head and neck MRI\/MRA was checked on ___ and \nshowed progressive multifocal T2 hyperintensity in bihemispheric \nand central pontine white matter; could represent small vessel \nischemic disease and\/or neurosarcoidosis. There was no \npathologic enhancement to suggest active inflammation due to \nneurosarcoidosis. The MRA of head and neck was unremarkable. An \nEEG was checked but results were pending at the time of \ndischarge. The patient ruled out for cardiac ischemia\/infarction \nwith a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes. He was monitored \non telemetry for 24 hours without event. Overall, it's unclear \nwhat caused the pre-syncope and altered mental status. The \npatient's cognitive function rapidly returned to normal even \nprior to admission and remained stable throughout \nhospitalization. He will be admitted to the hospital for all \nfuture cycles of chemotherapy for closer monitoring.\n\n# Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Admitted on cycle 2 day 1 of \nABVD. Did not get full dose of decarbazine on ___ due to \npre-syncope. He received the remainder of the decarbazine dose \non ___. He was continued on prophylaxis with fluconazole 400 mg \nPO\/NG Q24H, Acyclovir 400 mg PO\/NG Q8H, Sulfameth\/Trimethoprim \nSS 1 TAB PO\/NG DAILY. The patient will start Neupogen and Cipro \non ___. He was started on allopurinol due to elevated uric \nacid.  \n\n# Systemic Sarcoidosis: Involves skin, gut, eyes, lungs, and \npresumed neurosarcoid. On prednisone daily. He was continued on \nprednisone 25mg daily.  \n\n# Depression: Stable. Continued on fluoxetine 40mg daily\n\n# Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Compliant with home CPAP, which was \ncontinued during hospitalization.\n\n# History of AVNRT. This was transient during prior \nhospitalization and likely related to sepsis. At that time, \ncardiology recommended conservative treatment with beta \nblockers, since invasive ablation contraindicated in this \nimmunosuppressed pt. The patient was continued on metoprolol, \nbut switched to short acting metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg BID \nwhile hospitalized.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-EEG results pending at discharge\n-Patient will be admitted to the hospital for future \nchemotherapy\n-Will start Neupogen and Cipro ___.\n-New Rx for allopurinol\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

There has \nbeen interval development of indistinct pulmonary vascular \nmarkings.  Small- to moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions \nare more clearly delineated on the current exam.  The lung \nvolumes are seen.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent, likely \naccentuated due to AP technique and low inspiratory effort.  \nOsseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure and \nmoderate bilateral effusions. \n.\nPORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___. \nCOMPARISON:  Radiograph ___. \nFINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly with improved pulmonary \nvascular congestion but persistent moderate right and small left \npleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis and\/or \nconsolidation.  Diffuse haziness in upper abdomen suggest the \npossibility of ascites. \n.\nRENAL U\/S ___:\nINDICATION:  Assess for hydronephrosis and clot burden in the \nbladder. \nCOMPARISONS:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___. \nRENAL ULTRASOUND:  Assessment of the kidneys is somewhat limited \ndue to body habitus and overlying bowel gas.  The right kidney \nmeasures 9.5 cm.  The left kidney was not as well seen, \nmeasuring 9.6 cm.  No definite hydronephrosis is seen \nbilaterally.  The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter \nwith a 4.4 x 3.8 cm avascular lesion within the bladder. \nIMPRESSION:  No definite hydronephrosis on this limited study \nwith 4.4-cm avascular echogenbic lesion in the bladder. This \ncould reflect clot given the history though a mass is not \nexcluded. Consider contrast enhanced CT or direct visualization. \n \n.\nB\/L LENIs ___:\nINDICATION:  ___ male with new right bundle-branch \nblock, concern for PE, but unable to get CTA.  Assess for DVT. \nCOMPARISONS:  None. \nGrayscale and color Doppler sonographic evaluation was performed \nof the bilateral lower extremities.  Normal compressibility and \nflow was seen in the bilateral common femoral, superficial \nfemoral, popliteal, peroneal, and posterior tibial veins without \nevidence of DVT. Mild left sided subcutaneous edema noted. \nIMPRESSION:  No lower extremity DVT. \n.\nEcho ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left \natrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is \nunusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal \nwall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no \nventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is \nmildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The \ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \nnormal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be \ndetermined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. \nSignificant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The \npulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears \ncircumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of \ntamponade. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular \nglobal systolic function with moderate, symmetric LVH. Aortic \nstenosis is present but unable to quantify. Mild to moderate MR. \n___ RV is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. Small, circumferential \npericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of \ntamponade.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with hx dementia, prostate CA, and bladder CA who presents \nwith recent hx hematuria, recent ___ edema, and shortness of \nbreath.  He was found to have RBBB and ST changes, edema on CXR, \nand evidence of right heart strain on ECHO.  He was thought to \nhave (1) worsening heart failure due to NSTEMI vs. demand \nischemia vs. acute PE and (2) hematuria of undetermined cause.\n.\n# ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient presented with ___ edema \nand pulm edema on CXR and on exam (and recent subacute edema), \nconsistent with heart failure.  Differential for the cause of \nheart failures includes acute MI and acute PE.  No known liver \ndisease, but does have chronic renal insufficiency at baseline. \nInitially we diuresed the patient with IV Lasix, which improved \nhis exam but worsened his renal function to a creatinine of 2.2. \nHis blood pressures overall were not suggestive of cardiogenic \nshock, but he did have occassional systolic BPs below 90.  The \npatient might have a component of preload dependence as his \npressures improved with IVF and PRBC ___, and his heart \nfailure did not appear dramatically worse.  However, on \n___, he was noted to have severe scrotal and moderate \npre-sacral edema.  Lasix was restarted without worsening renal \nfunction (creatinine of 1.7 on discharge, which appears to be \nhis baseline).  He is being discharged on 20mg PO Lasix daily \nand will have electrolyte and creatinine lab follow up and \nmonitoring at the rehab facility.   \n.\n# POSSIBLE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Patient presented with shortness \nof breath, RBBB, tachypnea to ___ ___nd troponin leak. \n While these symptoms might be c\/w other etiologies such as \nheart failure and myocardial ischemia\/infarction, they were also \nvery concerning for PE.  In terms of PE risk, patient has factor \nV Leiden but no hx clot.  PE strongly considered in pt with \nright heart strain, elevated troponins, signs of right heart \nfailure more than left heart failure. Has renal failure so \nunlikely to tolerate CTA.  V\/Q scan unlikely to be useful given \nthe underlying pulmonary edema.  LENIs were negative.  The \nmedical team had a long conversation with the family about goals \nof care and about the possible PE in particular.  The family \nunderstood that their father might have a PE and that the PE \ncould kill him if untreated.  However, anticoagulating the \npatient with heparin (and later with warfarin) would have \nworsened his hematuria.  Given his age, fall risk, and the goals \nof care, we recommended not treating the patient.  The family \nunderstood the situation and the risks and did not want to \npursue CTA or empiric anticoagulation.  The patient did receive \nheparin subQ.\n.\n# NSTEMI \/ DEMAND ISCHEMIA: Patient presented with troponin leak \n(peaked at 1.55) and ST changes difficult to interpret in the \nsetting of RBBB, which was found to be pre-existing at least \nsince ___.  Catheterization not c\/w patient's goals of \ncare.  Heparin gtt also not in line with goals of care and would \nrisk worsening hematuria. We treated the patient with aspirin \n325mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily, and metoprolol 12.5mg QID \n(he was eventually transitioned to metoprolol XL 25mg, a lower \ntotal dose due to heart rates in the ___ when getting 50mg total \ndaily).  On ___, we tranfused 2 units blood for dropping HCT \n(to 25.5) and active GU bleeding in the setting of NSTEMI\/demand \nischemia.  The patient denied chest pain, and his troponin \ntrended down.  \n.\n# HEMATURIA: ___ be due to prostate CA or treatment or bladder \nCA or treatment.  Renal U\/S did reveal a lesion in the bladder \n(clot vs. mass).  Urology was consulted, and they recommended \nputting in a large-bore Foley to tamponade possible prostatic \nbleeding and to start finasteride 5mg daily.  Finasteride was \nstarted.  A ___ catheter was placed, but was removed ___ \nwhen he appeared to be obstructed.  He continued to pass blood \nand clots in his urine until ___ when the urine was clear.  He \ndid have to be straight cathed on ___ for obstruction, and we \ncontinued to monitor him with bladder scans.  As above, he was \ntransfused on ___.  We spoke with radiation oncology about the \npossibility of palliative radiation to stop bleeding.  They \nwould need to do preferably a cystoscopy (family did not want to \npursue this due to risk of anesthesia in their father) or a CT \nw\/ contrast (which we and the family did not want to pursue \ngiven the kidney disease).  CT without contrast might localize \nsource of bleeding enough to plan pelvic XRT.  Son wanted to \nconsider pursuing this if bleeding worsened and after meeting \nwith urology for outpatient follow up.  After transfusion on \n___, HCT remained stable around ~33.\n.\n# ___ (on CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE III): Chronic kidney \ndisease likely from DMII, unknown baseline, but appears to be in \nrange of 1.6-1.8 base on records from ___. \n Patient presented with creatinine of 1.6, which increased to \n2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Acute injury likely from prerenal \n(acute heart failure vs. over-diuresis) vs. obstruction (CA\/mass \nvs. clot).  Obstruction was thought to be less likely given no \nobvious hydro on renal u\/s.  Most likely prerenal is setting of \nover-diuresis.  Creatinine stabilized in range of ~1.7-1.8.\n.\n# DMII: On oral hypoglycemics at home.  Patient was put on \ninsulin sliding scale while here.\n.\n# GOALS OF CARE: Patient was DNR\/DNI at baseline.  On ___, the \nmedicine team, along with palliative care, met with the \nson\/POA\/HCP ___ and the pt's daughter ___ to discuss goals \nof care.  We agreed not to further pursue diagnosis or treatment \nof PE, given the patient's c\/i to IV contrast and given that we \nwould not want to treat him right now because of his stable \nrespiratory status, his GU bleeding, and his high fall risk.  \n___ and ___ are sure that they would like their father to go \nback to ___, the ___, and not to go to a nursing home\/SNF, or \nif he has to go, to go only temporarily.  We discussed the \noption of \"do not hospitalize,\" but the family did not seem \nready to make that decision.  We did, however, discuss hospice, \nand the son spoke to case management to see if the patient meets \ncriteria.  I spoke with the son again ___ about goals of care. \n In addition to reviewing what we talked about at the family \nmeeting on the day prior, we also talked about the option of \n\"allowing natural death\" and not transfusing blood if he were to \nhave increased bleeding from his GU tract.  Son expressed that \nto him and his sister, this would feel too much like \"pulling \nthe plug.\"  They are not ready to have their father be \"do not \nhospitalize\" or \"allow natural death,\" but they are aware that \nthese options exist for the future.  Case management spoke to \nthe family about hospice, and they would like to continue \nexploring this as an option for the future.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Patient's family would like to get their father back to ___ \n(assisted living) as soon as possible, but understands he will \nhave to go to a SNF first.\n- Patient's family may consider do not hospitalize (___) and\/or \nhospice in the future. \n- Urology follow-up is scheduled for early ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You had fluid in your lungs, which may have contributed to the shortness of breath. This fluid in your lungs may have been due to a heart attack, heart failure, a blood clot in your lungs, or a combination of these issues. It is very likely that you had a blood clot in your lungs, but we did not do the CT test to confirm this, given that it would likely further harm your kidneys. We also did not treat you for this blood clot, given that the treatment would increase your risk of having blood in your urine and increase the risk of you dying from a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract or head, especially if you were to fall. Your family agreed with this plan. We gave you Lasix (a diuretic) to decrease the fluid around your lungs. After we did this, your breathing improved. For your heart, we gave you aspirin (an increased dose compared to what you used to take), metoprolol (a beta-blocker, which decreases the work that your heart has does when pumping blood), and atorvastatin (which decreases cholesterol plaque formation in your arteries). You also had blood in your urine, which may have been coming from your prostate or your bladder. We transfused you with red blood cells in order to increase your red blood cell level.

Called her \noutpatient neurologist, ___, who recommended that \nshe speak with her PCP and nephrologist. Given she had a \nmonth-long episode of confusion in ___, she sought \nevaluation at the twice daily ___ emergency room today. Over the \npast few days she has felt more orthostatic than usual, feeling \nso lightheaded upon standing that she only felt comfortable \nmaking short snacks and meals, because she otherwise felt too \nunwell to stand. She remains at her baseline nausea and \nvomiting, having her last episode of nonbloody emesis morning of \npresentation.  \n She reports that the headache is similar to headache she has \nhad in the past centered on top of her head and radiating to her \nforehead. It began as an 8 out of 10 and improved to 2 out of 10 \nwith Aleve.  \n She describes her episode of confusion as feeling that her \nbathroom was \"evil and although she felt an urge to go to her \nkitchen and grabbed a knife to defend herself, she felt this was \n\"crazy\" and did not grab a knife. She currently denies feeling \nabnormal or having any unusual thoughts. She states that aside \nfrom a mild headache, she feels otherwise like her usual self. \nShe reports completing a course of antibiotics and remembers \nthat she was due to see the infectious disease clinic in the \nmorning.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \n (+) Per HPI  \n (-) 10 point ROS reviewed and negative unless stated above in \nHPI  \n \nPast Medical History:\n - Poorly controlled DM Type 1 complicated by neuropathy,  \n retinopathy, neurogenic bladder (intermittent straight  \n catheterization)  \n - Hypertension  \n - Dyslipidemia  \n 2.

Focal \narea of hypoenhancement involving the pancreatic neck and \nportions of the body and head, which are most consistent with \nearly pancreatic necrosis. \n2. Edema within the duodenal wall and gallbladder likely \nreactive in nature. \n3. Indeterminant 3-cm cystic appearing lesion exophytic off the \nupper pole of the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral \nsimple renal cysts. A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained \nfor further characterization the the 3cm indeterminate lesion as \nthe patient's clinical condition warrants.  \n4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent airspace \ndisease likely \nrepresenting predominantly atelectasis. \n\nEcho (___): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in \ncavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and \nglobal systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and \nfree wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated \nat the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally \nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. There is no \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular \ncavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic \nfunction. Grossly normal valve morphology without pathologic \nflow identified. \n\nCTA Torso (___):\n1. No definite pulmonary embolism identified. Limited evaluation \nof the \nsubsegmental branches on the left and the segmental and \nsubsegmental branches of the right pulmonary arteries secondary \nto bolus timing. \n2. Progression of marked edema and peripancreatic stranding, \nconsistent with patient's history of pancreatitis. Focal area of \nhypoenhancement involving the pancreatic neck and portions of \nthe body and head, most suggestive of pancreatic necrosis. No \norganized fluid collections identified. \n3. Indeterminate 3 cm cystic lesion exophytic off the upper pole \nof the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral renal \ncysts, which are \nredemonstrated. A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained for \nfurther \ncharacterization as previously recommended on an outpatient \nbasis. \n5. Small left pleural effusion and adjacent airspace disease, \nmost likely \nrepresenting atelectasis. \n6. An 8 mm filling defect within the splenic vein which may \nrepresent a tiny nonocclusive splenic vein thrombosis. \n\nKUB (___): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, \nthere is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices \nare in unchanged position.  Unchanged slight right hilar \nenlargement, retrocardiac atelectasis and suspicion of a small \nleft-sided pleural effusion. No newly occurred focal parenchymal \nopacities. Moderate overhydration. \n\nCT Abd (___) - IMPRESSION: \n1. Unchanged appearance of pancreas compatible with pancreatitis \nand areas of pancreatic necrosis at the pancreatic head, body \nand, to a lesser extent, tail. \n2. Unchanged appearance to bilateral renal cystic lesions which \nmay be \nfurther evaluated with ultrasound or MRI on a non-emergent \nbasis. \n3. Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions, \nmore marked on the left. \n \nEcho (___): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial \nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \nnormal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function appears normal (LVEF 50-60%). There is no \nventricular septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at \nthe sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on \nthe aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal \nimage quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, \nbut cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot \nbe quantified. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no \ndefinite ___. If indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a \nsmall valvular vegetation.\n\nTEE (___): No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color \nDoppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and \nglobal systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There \nare simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion and no aortic stenosis.

Extensive pancreatic necrosis. Although the quantity of fluid \nassociated with necrotic tissue appears slightly increased, \nresidual enhancing areas of the pancreas are similar in extent. \nAlthough gas formation is not noted in the pancreatic fluid \ncollection, infection of necrosis cannot be excluded. \n2. New mild diffuse bowel dilatation suggestive of a very mild \nileus. \n\nUpper Ext U\/S (___) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of thrombosis \nseen in right or left internal jugular or subclavian veins. \n\nKUB (___) - Two portable views of the abdomen were obtained, \nboth supine. One includes the diaphragms and the other includes \nthe obturator foramina. There are multiple loops of dilated \nsmall bowel. Gas is seen throughout much of the colon -- the \ncolon is distended, but not frankly dilated. The appearance is \nin keeping with the appearance on the CT scout film from ___. \nThe most likely etiology is ileus, though a partial small- bowel \nobstruction cannot be excluded.\n\nCXR (___) - Lung volumes are very low, crowding all of the \nnormal structures and abnormalities. Since ___ although heart \nsize may have increased only mildly, there is more mediastinal \nvascular engorgement and dilatation of upper lobe pulmonary \nvessels due to worsening cardiac decompensation or volume \noverload. Confluent opacification at the lung bases could be \nexplained by combination of atelectasis and confluent edema \nthough radiographically one cannot exclude aspiration or even \npneumonia. Pleural effusions if any are small. Tracheostomy tube \nin standard placement. Tip of the left subclavian line projects \nover the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.

Stable lung \nvolumes and \ninterval improvement in left basilar opacification. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of with HTN, \nDMII, HLD, morbid obesity who presented with severe acute \nnecrotizing pancreatitis.\n \n1. NECROTIZING PANCREATITIS: Etiology of the patient's \npancreatitis was not clear. CT imaging revealed a \npartially-necrosed pancreas with a fluid collection. There was \nno history of significant EtOH use, triglycerides were WNL, he \nhad not had a recent ERCP or steroid use, and there was no \nevidence of gallstones on imaging. His ___ score was \ncalculated to be >7. He received aggressive fluid resuscitation \nand was started on IV meropenem. Given his very significant \nresuscitation requirements, the patient was intubated to \nmaintain oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of worsening \nanasarca and third-spacing of fluid. Surgery did not feel that \nhis presentation warranted operative management. The patient \ninitially began to show interval improvement after the first 48 \nhours as measured by lab abnormalities and fluid resuscitaton \nrequirements, but then again decompensated with fevers > 103, a \nprecipitous rise in WBC, a diffuse rash, and hypotension \nrequiring more aggressive fluid resuscitation and eventual \ninitiation of vasopressors. Repeat imaging showed no evidence of \nprogression of necrotic pancreas or other any intra-abdominal \nprocess. The patient was empirically switched to \naztreonam\/flagyl given concern for a drug-induced reaction (see \nbelow). The patient was followed with serial CT scans of his \npancreas, which ultimately showed extensive pancreatic necrosis. \nHe was maintained on TPN until he was able to tolerate enteric \nfeeding. His clinical course was complicated by development of \nan ileus. His ileus was followed with serial KUB's and \neventually improved. Due to significant difficulty placing a \npost-pyloric feeding tube, he had an NG tube placed and was \nstarted on tube feeds, which he tolerated. He had a post-pyloric \nfeeding tube placed on ___ and tube feeds were continued. At \nthe time of discharge, he was tolerating tube feeds well and did \nnot require TPN. \n \n2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: His respiratory failure was secondary \nto LLL collapse and pulmonary edema and increased abdominal \ndistension from ileus and anascarca. Requiring PEEP initially as \nhigh as 18 likely secondary to increased intrabdominal pressure. \nWhen blood pressue was stable and he was able to be diuresed, he \nbegan to require less positive pressure. Dead space measurement \ndid not reveal a significant amount of dead space present, and \nhe was able to increasingly tolerate pressure support. \nUltimately, he underwent trach placement. He was transitioned to \ntrach mask ventilation and had a Passy-Muir Valve placed. Of \nnote, on the afternoon after having the sutures removed from his \ntracheostomy site, the patient's trach tube was noted to be out \nof proper position. Anesthesia and CT surgery urgently evaluated \nthe patient. He was transiently intubated, and his trach was \nreplaced at the bedside. The patient did not have any further \nproblems with his tracheostomy. As he approached discharge, the \npatient remained grossly fluid overloaded. Diuresis with IV \nlasix should be continued with a goal of ___ L negative a day. \nAt the time of discharge he is slighly positive for length of \nstay.  He will require further weaning from the trach mask.\n\n3. BACTEREMIA\/ FEVERS:  As above, he was initially started on \nmeropenem on admission for severe pancreatitis.  The meropenum \nwas transitioned to aztreonam after he developed skin changes \nconcerning for an allergic reaction. He continued to spike daily \nfevers, which were felt to possibly be related to his \npancreatitis but also possibly related to an underlying \ninfection. Eventually, he grew coag neg staph sensitive to \nlinezolid in consecutive blood cultures from ___ and then \ncoag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood \nculture on ___. Additionally, he grew pan-sensitive enterococcus \nfaecalis in consecutive blood cultures from ___. His \ncentral venous lines were the suspected source. However, his \ndiffuse skin breakdown in the setting of his allergic reaction \nwas also thought to be a possible source of his staph. He \nunderwent multiple CVL changes, given these positive cultures. \nTEE negative for vegetations or abscesses. Also, he grew \nacinetobacter from a right IJ blood cx on ___ and from multiple \nsputum cultures. Given his various positive cultures, he was \nfollowed by the infectious disease service, who recommended \nvarious adjustments to his antibiotic regimen. He was unable to \nbe started on vancomycin because of a questionable history \nallergy reported from another facility.  Allergy was consulted \nand felt that he is unlikely to be allergic to vancomycin; \nhowever, to be safe he should undergo a desensitization if \nvancomycin was necessary.  He was placed on aztreonam, amikacin, \nand linezolid. However, aztreonam was ultimately stopped as it \nappeared that the acinetobacter was not susceptible. He was \ntried on tigecycline but developed a questionable allergic \nreaction. At the time of discharge, the infectious disease team \nrecommended a total 14 day course of amikacin to end on ___.  \n\n3. SKIN RASH: As above, the patient was initially started on \nmeropenem on admission. However, he thereafter developed a \nclinical decompensation, including a diffuse rash. This rash \nconsisted of significant erythema and desquamation and \nultimately covered a significant portion of the patient's upper \nand lower extremities as well as his trunk. When he developed \nthis rash, he was empirically switched to aztreonam\/flagyl given \nconcern for a drug-induced reaction (i.e. DRESS syndrome).  \nDermatology was consulted and agreed that the rash likely \nrepresented a drug reaction but felt that the likely inciting \nagent was unasyn approximately two weeks prior to rash \ndevelopment. Biopsies were performed and were also consistent \nwith a hypersensitivity reaction. Later in his hospital course, \nthe patient was started on tigecycline, after which he was noted \nto develop a new papular rash, concerning for an allergy. The \ntigecycline was promptly discontinued. Allergy and Immunology \nwas consulted to comment on patient's multiple skin reactions to \nvarious antibiotics, and it was thought the culprit was \ntigecycline since it correlated to his time course. However, if \ntigecycline would be needed in the future, the patient could \nundergo desensitization. Pt's skin rash improved throughout \nhospital course and he was seen multiple times by the wound care \nteam who left excellent recommendations for care, which was \ntranscribed into his discharge paperwork for continuation at \nrehab. \n\n4. ABDOMINAL DISTENTION\/ ILEUS : The ___ hospital course \nwas complicated by a prolonged ileus. There was some initial \nconcern for c.diff, and he was kept on flagyl for an extended \nperiod of time, given the impossibility of collecting stool \nsamples.  However, stool samples were eventually negative for C. \ndiff.  His ileus was followed by serial KUB's. After several \nunsuccessful attempts at placement of a post-pyloric feeding \ntube, he was started on gastric tube feedings. He subsequently \ndeveloped marked abdominal distention and tube feeds were held.  \nHis ileus improved after weaning narcotics and a few doses of \nmethylnaltrexone. After the patient's ileus improved, he was \nrestarted on tube feeds and tolerated them well.\n\n5. AGITATION\/ DELERIUM: Given his intubation, the patient was \ninitially on large amounts of IV sedation. After tracheostomy \nplacement, the patient's sedation was weaned. In the setting of \nweaning his sedation, he began to experience some agitation and \ndelirium, for which he was started on standing methadone and \nhaldol. As these medications were tapered, he was started on \nstanding seroquel. At time of discharge, pt was A&Ox3, at his \nbaseline and had good insight into his condition. \n\n6. DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK: His pancreatitis was complicated by \nhypotension, ultimately requiring pressors. The etiology was \nlikely multifactoiral, including his pancreatitis, his \nbacteremia, and his sedation while he was intubated. As his \nclinical status improved and his sedation was weaned, his \nhypotension improved and his pressors were weaned and stopped. \n\n7. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient presented with acute renal \nfailure, which initially improved with IV hydration. His \nhospital course was complicated by some additional elevations in \nhis creatining, generally in the setting of CT scans. At the \ntime of discharge, his creatinine was stable and within normal \nlimits.\n\n8. ANEMIA Patient's hematocrit slowely trended down during his \nhospitalization. NG tube contents and stool were both guaiac \nnegative, and felt to be secondary to repeated phelbotomy. His \nhematocrit was trended and he was transfused PRN to maintain a \nHCT above 21. His blood counts had been stable for several days \nprior to discharge.\n\n9. TYPE II DIABETES, c\/b neuropathy: The patient was continued \non sliding scale insulin and was given insulin in his TPN.  \nFollowing transfer from TPN  to tube feeds he required lantus \nand an insulin sliding scale with meals. Due to high blood \nsugars, lantus 10u daily was added to his regimen, and he will \ncontinue on hospital humalog sliding scale, which may need to be \nadjusted as appropriate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nTRANSFER MEDS:\nTylenol ___ Q6H\nHeparin 5000u SQ Q12H\nDilaudid PCA not started\nLisinopril 20 mg daily\nMetoprolol 100 mg daily\nMetoprolol 50 mg QHS\nZofran 4mg Q6H PRN\nZocor 20 mg PO  \n \nHOME MEDS:\nAspirin 81mg Daily\nMetformin 500mg BID \nMetoprolol 200mg AM 100mg ___\nGlyburide 5mg BID\nLisinopril 20mg Daily\nAmlodipine 5mg daily\nNeuremedy 150mg BID\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

In one year, his Plavix should be \nreplaced by ASA\n[] Should consider cardiac rehab program after discharge\n[] He was transitioned from pravastatin 20mg to atorvastatin \n80mg. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n# CAD s\/p CABG \n# s\/p ___ 5 to RCA CTO ___ c\/b aortic root\/RCA dissection\nPatient with history of CAD with CABG in ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, \nand SVG-RCA). On his most recent cath, patient was noted to have \nCTO of mid LAD, LIMA-LAD patent, occluded SVG-OM and RCA, and \nCTO of the RCA. Due to ongoing chest pain despite 3 antianginal \nmedications, he underwent elective revascularization of his \nknown CTO RCA. During this hospitalization, his coronary \nangiogram showed severe tortuosity beginning in the mid segment \nof the RCA, with 70% stenosis with a TIMI flow grade of 0 in the \nproximal and mid segments, a 100% stenosis in the mid and distal \nsegments, and significant collaterals. During initial access to \nthrough R radial catheter was kinked and angiogram showed a \nsmall perforation in the brachial artery that was closed with a \nFr. guide and a BP cuff. Access was then obtained through L \nradial, 5 stents total were placed to the RCA. Angiogram during \ncath showed distal dissection into the RPDA\/RPL (wire induced \nmost likely, no intervention performed) with TIMI 3 flow, as \nwell as an aortic root\/proximal RCA dissection at the origin \nrequiring ___. Final angiogram showed no residual, \nstable ___ RCA\/ aortic dissection as well as distal RPDA \ndissection and TIMI 3 flow. Following the procedure, he \ncontinued to report chest pain and was started on an IV nitro \ndrip with a brief drop of his blood pressure when he was given \nmorphine. He was admitted to the CCU on the nitro drip and his \nBP stabilized and his chest pain resolved. His CK-MB was trended \nand peaked prior to discharge. Focused TTE showed overall \npreserved left ventricular systolic function and normal right \nventricle free wall motion, no pericardial effusion. He was \ndischarged on atorvastatin 80mg, ASA, Plavix, and warfarin with \nplan to continue triple therapy for 1 month and then continue \nwith Plavix and warfarin. His anti-anginal medications were not \nchanged during this admission. \n\n# A fib: \nHe was started on a heparin drip while inpatient and started on \nwarfarin 5mg two days prior to discharge. He was given \ninstructions to take warfarin 5mg the night of discharge and \nthen to resume his home regimen of 2.5 mg x 6 days and 5 mg on \n___. He is managed by Dr. ___ has an INR check \nfor ___. He was continued on his home metoprolol 100mg BID.\n\n# HTN: \nHis amlodipine was held while his blood pressures were low and \nwas restarted on the day of discharge as his blood pressure \nimproved.

However, he failed void trial on ___ early AM \nand bladder scan demonstrated urinary retention.  His Foley was \nreplaced and he will be discharged to rehab with the foley in \nplace.  The DDx includes spinal compression injury, though neuro \nexam is stable and the patient's lower extremity is strong \nmaking this very unlikely.  Could also be bladder irritation due \nto having a Foley in place for 5 days after surgery.  Unlikely \nthat he has UTI given absence of other infectious symptoms, but \nwe sent UA to confirm.  Another contributing factor could be \npain medication because pt is on Tramadol (Tylenol was held to \nprevent fever masking).  ID Consult allowed switching to Tylenol \nand stopping the Tramadol prior to discharge.\n.\n#Fevers:  Patient spiked fevers to 103.1 on POD2 but has been \nafebrile since then.  At present he does not have any active \nsigns of infection.  CXR, UA did not demonstrate signs of \ninfection.  His right knee did not demonstrate signs of \ninfection, and Ortho was consulted and agreed with this \nassessment.  His incision also did not appear to be a source of \ninfection.  ID was consulted and we followed their \nrecommendations including continuing home suppressive Abx \nagainst his chronic polymicrobial joint infection and holding \nTylenol to avoid masking fevers.   The patient did receive \nseveral doses of IV daptomycin for empiric coverage, the last \none was on ___.  He did not develop fevers since the IV \ndaptomycin was discontinued.  Most likely the patient \nexperienced non-infectious post-op fever.\n.\n#Hx polymicrobial Right knee infection: The patient has been \nable to continue his prophylaxis (moxifloxacin, fluconazole) and \nwas treated with IV daptomycin intraoperatively per outpt ID. \nOrtho was consulted and agreed that he had no signs of active \njoint infection.  Knee x-ray did not demonstrate any signs of \ninfection. ID was also consulted and recommended IV Daptomycin \nwhich was started ___ until ___.  He remained afebrile since \nPOD2 on ___, and his knee never demonstrated evidence for \nactive infection. His IV Daptomycin was dc'd on ___ and he \nremained afebrile.  He was discharged on his suppressive \nantibiotic regimen which includes moxifloxacin and fluconazole.\n.\n#Acute Kidney Injury: Pt's creatinine has vacillated between 1.5 \nand 1.8 over the past year, was elevated to 2.3 on ___ after \nreceiving IV  Lasix.  His Cr demonstrated excellent response to \nIV fluids, steadily declining to 1.3 on ___.  Most likely he \nwas intravascularly depleted given excellent response to fluids, \nthough we did consider ATN and rhabdo given initially high CK.  \nNephrotoxic drugs such as ibuprofen were avoided once he \ndeveloped ___. Cr was 1.2 at the time of discharge. \n.\n# Hypotension- BPs dropped from 160s on admission to ___ \nsystolic on ___.  After IV fluid administration his BP \nimproved and he became hypertensive, at which point his home \nantihypertensive medications were restarted.  His SBP have since \nbeen as high as the 150s on his home BP meds. given the absence \nof an infectious source and the fact that the patient received \nIV Lasix and developed prerenal acute kidney injury, the most \nlikely cause of his hypotension was volume depletion.   \n.\n#Spinal Stenosis  -___  s\/p L1-L5 laminectomy, foraminotomy and \nprimary repair of CSF leak due to a dural tear and corrected \nwith a suture on ___.  The surgical incision site remained \nclean, intact without erythema or drainage.  The patient's \npost-surgical pain was controlled with tramadol.  Tylenol was \nnot given in order to unmask any fevers.  He had no activity \nlimitations per neurosurgery, and ___ was consulted.  He was \ndischarged to rehab for additional physical therapy.  He should \nfollow-up with neurosurgery NP or his PCP for suture removal \n___ days after his operation (___).  He should follow up \nwith Dr. ___ ___ weeks after surgery.   \n.\n#Hypertension- The patient's antihypertensives were suspended \nfor about 2 days after he became hypotensive ___.  His \nhypotension resolved following IV fluid resuscitation and his \nhome medications were restarted.  He was discharged to rehab on \nhis home lisinopril and HCTZ \n.\n#Glaucoma - continued home medications\n.\n#neuropathy - continued gabapentin\n.\nTransitional Issues:\n- The patient should follow-up with neurosurgery NP or his PCP \nfor suture removal ___ days after his operation (___).  \n- He should also follow up with Dr. ___ ___ weeks after \nsurgery.  \n- If the patient is unable to pass his void trial at rehab, he \nwill need follow-up with urology.\n- The patient should follow-up with his infectiuos disease \nphysician ___ 2 weeks after discharge.\n.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There is no pneumothorax. \nIMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process\n\nCARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___:\nCoronary angiography: right dominant\n  LMCA: The LMCA was long but patent.\n  LAD: The LAD was calcified proximally and had mild plaquing\njust before D1. There was a patent stent in the mid LAD just\nafter D1. There was 40% stenosis just after the stent and prior\nto an intramyocardial segment with slightly slow flow. The \ndistal\nLAD wrapped around the apex.\n  LCX: There was a proximal 40% CX lesion followed by a 70%\nstenosis just before the large OM1. The AV groove CX was small\nafter OM1. There were serial 70% stenoses in OM2 into two\nbifurcating LPL terminal branches.\n  RCA: The RCA had diffuse plaquing throughout to 35% with mild\ncalcification and mildly slow flow consistent with microvascular\ndysfunction.\nAssessment & Recommendations\n 1. Moderate single vessel CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis and\ndiffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction.\n 2. Iatrogenic systemic arterial hypotension without obvious\nevidence of anaphylactoid reaction after IA TNG and diltiazem\nwith low normal LVEDP and no reported use of PDE-5 inhibitors.\nPatient's SBP seemed very sensitive to IA and IC TNG.\n 3.

Extensive coronary artery calcification, mainly \ninvolving the LAD, found incidentally on CT trachea on ___. \nWhile patient had atypical chest pain symptoms and negative \ntroponin x3, he is high-risk (CAD, current smoker, hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia) and reported that prodrome of nausea, \ndiaphoresis, and dyspnea on exertion were similar to prior \npresentation for MI. Therefore, decision made to proceed with \ncardiac catheterization. Catheterization done through right \nradial approach. There were serial moderate stenoses in the LCX; \npressure wire evaluation negative. Single vessel CAD with \ndiffuse atherosclerosis and diffuse slow flow consistent with \nmicrovascular dysfunction. Given that patient's symptoms not \ntypical for ischemia and negative pressure wire evaluation of \nthe LCX, aggressive medical therapy was indicated rather than \nPCI, especially given slow flow consistent with microvascular \ndisease that would not be addressed with PCI of epicardial \nvessels. Patient was therefore continued on high-dose ASA, \nhigh-dose statin, ACEI, beta-blocker, and addition of \nlong-acting anti-ischemic medication. Patient was also counseled \non smoking cessation to decrease his cardiac risk factors. \nPatient was clinically stable for discharge on HD#2 with close \nfollow up by Primary Care Provider and ___ (Dr. \n___.

He was able to be paced out of VT, received a \nbolus of amiodarone, was started on a gtt, and eventually \ntransitioned to an oral amiodarone regimen. Pt underwent \nablation, with success in 1 of 2 foci. Pt's pacer setting was \nchanged to Anti-Tachycardia Pacing at 122bpm, and his \nbeta-blocker was titrated up. Pt was monitored on telemetry with \nno additional arrhythmias. \n  \n# Groin bleed - Pt's ablation was complicated by a bleed after \nremoval of the venous and arterial sheaths. Pt developed a new \nbruit which was evaluated by a femoral ultrasound. This showed \nan AV fistula, in the setting of INR 2 and PTT 78. Vascular \nsurgery was consulted and did not feel surgical intervention was \nnecessary unless pt developed uncontrollable bleeding, \nhypoperfusion to the extremity or high output heart failure. Pt \ndid not develop any of these complications, maintained a stable \nHct for several days and on reevaluation by ultrasound had \nresolution of the AV fistula. \n\n# Hypertension - Continue home meds. No active issues.  \n \n# History of Atrial fibrillation - Pt remained in sinus rhythm \nthoughout admission. His coumadin was held given the ablation, \nand not restarted in the setting of groin bleed\/ AV fistula. \nUpon resolution of these issues, pt was restarted on \nanticoagulation with Lovenox bridge to be administered by ___, \nand INR follow up.   \n\n# h\/o DVT - Pt was prophylaxed with pneumoboots while \nanticoagulation was held.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAmiodarone 200 mg PO daily  \nToprol XL 75 mg PO daily  \nSpironolactone 25 mg PO daily  \nHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO daily  \nDigoxin 0.0625 mg PO QOD  \nSertraline 25 mg PO daily  \nWarfarin 2 mg ___  \nWarfarin 1 mg ___  \nDocusate Sodium 100 mg PO daily  \nFish Oil 1 gram daily  \nAtorvastatin 40 mg PO daily  \nImdur ER 90 mg PO daily  \nHydralazine 50 mg PO TID  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

On arrival \nthe the ED, vitals were 97.7 65 133\/67 18 100%. She was unable \nto say why she was in the emergency department. She denied any \nsymptoms, including no chest pain, abdominal pain. No shortness \nof breath, cough, bladder or bowel symptoms. Her labs were \nnotable for WBC 11.1, hct 32.5, cr 0.4, normal lytes.

The patient was then brought to the \nangiography \nsuite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure \ntime-out was \nperformed per ___ protocol. The left upper chest was prepped \nand draped in \nthe usual sterile fashion. \nUnder continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent left internal \njugular vein \nwas compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. \nPermanent \nultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous \naccess, which \nconfirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed \ninto the right \natrium using fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged \nfor a \nmicropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short \nAmplatz wire \nwas advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter \nlength. The wire \nwas then passed distally into the IVC. \nNext, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the \nupper \nanterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper \nlocal anesthesia \nusing lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision \nwas made at the \ntunnel entry site. A 23cm tip-to-cuff length catheter was \nselected. The \ncatheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy \nsite from where \nit was brought out using a tunneling device.  The venotomy tract \nwas dilated \nusing the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following \nthis, the \npeel-away sheath was placed over the ___ wire through which \nthe catheter was \nthreaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the \nright atrium. \nThe sheath was then peeled away. The catheter was sutured in \nplace with 0 silk \nsutures. Steri-strips were also used to close the venotomy \nincision site. \nFinal spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of \nthe catheter and \nno kinking. The tip is in the right atrium.

Patient was \nadmitted to ___, at which time she was started on daptomycin. \nRepeat blood cultures were obtained, and the last positive blood \nculture was on ___ growing enterococcus that was resistant to \nvancomycin. The patient continued on IV therapy, and she was \nclinically improving, denying any fevers, chills, chest pain, \npalpitations, and throughout her hospitalization had no stigmata \nof endocarditis. The source of the infection was likely due to \nher HD line.\n\nID was consulted, and the recommendations included continuing \ndaptomycin, removing her HD line, and getting a TEE to determine \nthe course of antibiotic therapy. The patient had her HD line \nremoved, was on a line holiday, with replacement of her HD line \n48 hours after removal. Patient had no issues with removal, \nblood cultures were persistently negative, and her TEE did not \nshow any evidence of endocarditis. She was stable throughout her \ntime in the hospital. The patient had initially NG tube \nplacement, but prior to discharge given intolerance of NG tube \nthe patient and care team elected to remove the NG tube.

Patient was hemodynamically stable, \nand transferred to the floor. Her last blood culture was \npositive on ___ growing enterococcus resistant to \nvancomycin sensitive to daptomycin. The source of the infection \nwas likely line infection although diarrheal illness was \ninitially considered. TTE was initially performed with a \npossible vegetation, although later TEE was reassuring for no \nsigns of endocarditis. ID was consulted this hospitalization and \nprovided recommendations for infection management. She had a \nline holiday for her HD line, with replacement of her HD line on \n___, for which she continue daptomycin with dialysis. Her CK \nlevels were unremarkable. The patient was maintained on \nMidodrine. She was scheduled to complete 2 weeks of daptomycin \ntreatment, with the last 2 courses to be infused via her midline \nas an outpatient.\n\n#Dislodged HD catheter\n#ESRD on ___ HD\n#Hepatorenal syndrome\nThe patient had HD line placed upon arrival to the ICU, was \nstable on hemodialysis. She was maintained on midodrine, \ncontinued hemodialysis through her tunneled HD line, and was \ncontinued on her home Nephrocaps and sevelamer.\n\n#Encephalopathy, resolved \nThe patient's encephalopathy was likely multifactorial although \nthere was a large component from her VRE bacteremia. \nEncephalopathy improved with antibiotics and lactulose, the \npatient was awake and alert oriented x3 and did not have any \nasterixis on exam.

This constellation is consistent with \northostatic hypotension (and frank hypotension) from \nover-treating of her blood pressure. I suspect she actually has \nquite brittle blood pressure (though normal here), and when she \nswings low on her antihypertensives she becomes symptomatic. Her \nACE-I likely just exacerbated her problems. She was continued on \ntelemetry for 24 hours with no arrhythmias.

Your blood pressure was also found to be low. I stopped all your blood pressure medications except clonidine, and your blood pressure was normal while you were in the hospital. I suspect that the cause of your dizziness and kidney injury were the same -- your blood pressure medicines are controlling your blood pressure TOO well. Therefore, I am HOLDING your chlorthalidone and lisinopril and only continuing your clonidine (this should also be tapered off over time). You will see your neurologist tomorrow. You should have a blood pressure check at this time. If your systolic blood pressure is > 160, you should restart the chlorthalidone.

She was supported with IV \nfluids to prevent dehydration.  Cipro and flagyl were initially \ngiven for a planned 10 day course.  She was provided with \nanti-emetics as needed as well as morphine for pain control.  A \nrepeat CT of the abdomen was performed on ___ and the \ninflammation initially visualized in the sigmoid colon had \nresolved.  The radiologist also suspected that it may have been \nepiploic appendagitis, not diverticulitis, on the first CT.  \nAntibiotics were discontinued, and given that the patient was \nnot taking good POs, she was started on IV Toradol for pain \ncontrol.  On hospital day #6, the pain was much improved and the \npatient tolerated a bland diet.  On hospital day #7, she was \ntransitioned to all oral pain medications and advanced to a \nregular diet.  She tolerated this well and was discharged home \non oral pain medications.\n.\n# Right ___ pain:\nUnderwent bunionectomy and tendon lengthening by podiatry in \n___.  Although it is difficult to get a history from the \npatient because of her expressive aphasia, after discussing with \nthe patient's PCP, the pain was felt to be worse than her \nbaseline.  Podiatry was consulted and plain films obtained.  \nUric acid level checked per podiatry's recommendations and was \nnormal.  There was no evidence of fracture on X-Ray, but there \nwas concern that the patient may have damage to her right flexor \nhallucis tendon.  MRI demonstrated tendinosis, but no definite \ndamage to the tendon.  Podiatry recommended a multipodus splint, \ninitiation of a muscle relaxant and applied a bunion splint.  \nThe patient had some improvement in the positioning of her toe \nwith these interventions and will follow up with podiatry as an \noutpatient.  She will keep the multipodus and bunion splints on \nat home and continue Flexeril for one week.\n.\n# Hematocrit drop from admission:\nAttributed to IV fluids.  Patient's hematocrit stabilized at 33. \n She can follow-up with her primary physician if her ___ does \nnot return to baseline after discharge.\n.\n# Bruit on abdominal exam:\nNo aortic aneurysm or dilation noted on CT abdomen.  Most likely \nrenal artery stenosis.  Creatinine remained normal.  Follow up \nas indicated as outpatient.\n.\n# HTN:\nNot on antihypertensives since hydrochlorothiazide stopped in \n___.  BP has been normal at her nursing home per her \nPCP's note, and remained normal to mildly elevated during her \nstay despite not being on BP meds.  She should follow up with \nher primary care physician for long term management if her blood \npressures are not normotensive as an outpatient.  \n.\n# history of stroke - continued aspirin.

Left ventricular wall \nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular \nsystolic function is hyperdynamic (Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = \n76%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II \n(moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally \nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nleft ventricular systolic function is more vigorous. There is \nprogression of diastolic dysfunction from mild to moderate. \nPulmonary artery systolic pressure can now be determined and is \nmildly increased. Other findings are similar.  \n\nDISCHARGE LABS: \n==================================\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ F w\/ hx of an undefined myeloproliferative \ndisorder on hydroxyurea and allopurinol, COPD, DM2, presenting \nwith 2 weeks of diarrhea and lethargy, 1 week of dysuria and \nrash, admitted to ___ for shock.\n\nFICU COURSE:\nThe patient was transferred from ___ with hypovolemic \nvs. distributive shock given infectious symptoms and poor PO \nintake for 1 week prior to admission. Her leukocytosis was \nchronic but profound to >100. Patient was evaluated by heme-onc \nwho felt that elevation was likely a leukamoid response to \ninfection and not evidence of transformation especially given \nlack of blasts on cell differential. She was given IV fluids and \nstarted on ciprofloxacin and flagyl initially for suspected \nGI\/GU source given diarrhea and dysuria with positive UA. She \nwas observed to be apneic with desaturations at night in the ICU \nand complained of SOB thought to be secondary to her COPD amd \nmild pulmonary edema requiring 4L O2 by NC. Urine cultures from \noutside hospital were positive for klebsiella. Her cipro was \ndiscontinued and started ceftriaxone per sensitivities on \nklebsiella. Stool studies were negative and urine culture at \nthis hospital was negative. She was also noted to have a diffuse \npruritic rash which dermatology evaluated and thought likely \nsecondary to allopurinol or hydroxyurea so both of these \nmedications were held. She improved and was transferred to the \nmedical oncology floor for continued management but still with \nan O2 requirement of ___.\n\nMEDICAL ONCOLOGY COURSE:\nUpon arrival the patient was fatigued and requiring ___ of \noxygen on NC. Her floor course was complicated by a GI bleed and \n___ in addition to her klebsiella UTI, dyspnea, and \nmyeloproliferative disorder. Details by problem are as follows:\n\n# Upper GI Bleed: Patient had an episode of melena followed by a \nsudden drop in her hematocrit. She required 5 units PRBCs from \n___. Initially she was unable to undergo EGD given O2 \nrequirement and risky intubation. Her O2 was weaned as her \nrespiratory status improved. On ___ she underwent EDG which \nshowed a bleeding duodenal ulcer that was treated with thermal \ntherapy.   \n- Cont PPI\n\n#  Dyspnea: Patient presented with intermittent dyspnea, \ntachypnea, and hypoxia.  Likely multifactorial in the setting of \nsome volume overload, reactive airway disease, COPD and likely \nOSA.  Patient does not seem to have an obvious COPD exacerbation \ncurrently and has never been treated with steroids for her COPD \nand does not require O2 at home.  No evidence of pulmonary \ninfectious process per chest imaging.  Serial CXR's have been \nstable. She was treated with gentle diuresis for mild pulmonary \nedema and her O2 requirement decreased. She was also started on \nadvair and given Levalbuterol & tiotropium prn. An ECHO was \ncompleted which showed possible diastolic dysfunction. See \nreport for details.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia likely \nsecondary to myeloproliferative disorder given decrease in all \ncell lines.  Labs inconsistent with consumptive process. \nUnlikely to be ___ hydrea as this was d\/c'd on ___. \n\n# UTI: Patient with Klebsiella UTI as described above. \nTrasnitioned from braod spectrum antibiotics to ceftriaxone (d1 \non ___ and then to cipro to be completed on ___.

He continued to have chest pain with CE elevation \nand was taken to the cath lab on ___.  The cath showed \ntwo-vessel disease.  The LCx had moderate in-stent restensosis \nand thrombus extending from the proximal portion to the middle \nof the vessel.  The RCA had diffuse mild disease and minimal \nin-stent restenosis and a moderate discrete lesion in the mid \nPDA. He had a successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the \nproximal and mid LCx with a 2.5 x 28mm Xience drug eluting stent \nwhich was postdilated to 3.0mm. Final angiography revealed no \nangiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis, and \nTIMI 3 flow. His CEs showed a peak CK=2140 with Trop 3.88 and MB \n143 on ___.  Patient was continued on aspirin and plavix upon \nreturn to the unit.  Experienced occasional chest discomfort \nwhile in-house but each episode was mild and lasted no more than \n10 seconds.  No EKG changes.  Upon discharge, patient was \ncomfortable.  Denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, \npalpitations, edema.  He will need to be continued on aspirin \n325mg indefinitely as well as Plavix 75mg daily for at least one \nyear. He is also on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily and high \ndose Atorvastatin. \n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal \natrial fibrillation.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm after \namiodarone was started and he was amiodarone loaded with 400mg \nBID for 1 week.  He will be discharged on amiodarone 400mg daily \nfor 1 week and then amiodarone 200mg daily indefinitely.  \nCoumadin was held in the setting of his lower GI bleed and he \nwill continue on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily\n.\n# BRBPR: The patient has known radiation proctitis s\/p XRT for \nprostate cancer.  He had a colonoscopy with argon plasma \ncoagulation in early ___ for a GI bleed then.  His GI bleed was \nreactivated once anticoagulation was restarted before his \ncardiac cath.  His hematocrit dropped significantly and he \nrequired 5 units of pRBCs during his hospital course to maintain \nhis hematocrit.  GI was consulted and at first recommended \nCarafate enemas to help coat his known radiation proctitis \nulcers.  These enemas seemed to induce bowel movements which \nfurther irritated his GI bleed.  They were discontinued and the \npatient was scheduled for a repeat flex sig with argon plasma \ncoagulation in an attempt to stop the bleeding source.  This \ntook place ___ and was successful, although GI reports that he \nwill likely rebleed and need a repeat procedure as an \noutpatient. \n.\n# Acute renal failure: His baseline creatinine was around 1.2, \nbut was 1.8 on admission.  It was likely of pre-renal etiology \nand his creatinine improved with increased PO intake and holding \nhis Lasix. Low dose Lasix was restarted on discharge as his \ncreatinine had normalized.  \n.\n# Cholecystectomy: He initially had an elevated white count s\/p \nprocedure which resolved. Surgery followed him throughout his \nadmission. He was able to tolerate a low fat diet prior to \ndischarge. He is scheduled to see his surgeon after discharge. \n.  \n# Hypertension: He did have some hypotension early on in his \nadmission.  His home metoprolol and valsartan were continued on \ndischarge. \n.  \n# Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure: His clinical exam was \nmonitored closely to evaluate his fluid status and his home dose \nlasix of Lasix was restarted at discharge.   \n.  \n# Diabetes mellitis: Blood sugars were well controlled on an \ninsulin sliding scale in addition to glipizide.\n.  \n# ___ disease: His home selegiline was continued.\n.  \n# Gout: His home colchicine was continued on discharge after \nbeing held in the setting of his acute coronary syndrome.\n.  \n# Migraine and cluster headaches: Pain was treated with Percocet \nPRN and his home cyclobenzaprine with good effect.\n.\nCODE: The patient's code status was confirmed as full code.  \n.\nCOMM: ___ wife, ___ home, ___\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAtorvastatin [Lipitor] 40 mg Tablet one Tablet(s) by mouth daily \n  \nColchicine 0.6 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day   \nCyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a \nday as needed for back pain   \nFurosemide 20 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily   \nGlipizide 5 mg Tablet 0.5 (One half) Tablet(s) by mouth once a \nday   \nIsosorbide Mononitrate 10 mg Tablet 1.5 Tablet(s) by mouth twice \na day 15 mg twice a day \nLeuprolide [Lupron Depot] Dosage uncertain Metoprolol Succinate \n100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr \n___ Tablet(s) by mouth once a day   \nNitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual 1 (One) Tablet(s) \nsublingually as needed   \nSelegiline HCl 5 mg Capsule 1 Capsule(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)  \n\nValsartan 80 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)   \nWarfarin 5 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth as directed   \nDocusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule 1 Capsule(s) by mouth twice a day \nhold for diarrhea   \nSodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray ___ Aerosol(s) \nintranasally four times a day as needed for nasal dryness \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Mild ligamentum \nflavum \nthickening is seen at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1.  No significant \nspinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis is seen.  There is no \nacute fracture or \nmalalignment. \n  \nThere is an intrathecal catheter which courses from the pump, \nwhich is not \nvisualized, through the left subcutaneous soft tissues of the \nback, between the L2-3 spinous process and into the thecal sac.  \nTwo linear hyperdensities are noted within the soft tissues at \nthe level of the L3 spinous process, consistent with surgical \nsutures.  Minimal stranding is noted within the posterior soft \ntissues, at the level of the L3 spinous process, likely \nsecondary to postsurgical changes.  No fluid collection or soft \ntissue mass is identified along the course of the catheter.  The \ncatheter extends from the through the T11- L2 spinal canal.  No \ndiscontinuity is noted in the visualized catheter. \n  \nA fluid-filled distended bladder is seen.  Multiple sub cm \nhypodensities are noted in the kidneys, which are too small to \ncharacterize and likely represent simple cysts. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Minimal soft tissue stranding in the posterior soft tissues \nof the back, at the L2-3 level, consistent with postsurgical \nchanges.  No fluid collection or abscess identified along the \ncourse of the visualized catheter. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with chronic pudendal impingement syndrome s\/p intrathecal \npump for ziconotide infusion who was admitted for acute urinary \nretention and pain at intrathecal pump catheter site.\n\n#Acute urinary retention - Timing seems to coincide with recent \nincrease in ziconotide dose on ___. ___ Pain service was \nconsulted and recommended decreasing the ziconotide dose 20%, to \nprevious dose. However, ___ Pain service only has equipment \nfor ___ pumps and were not able to interrogate or adjust \nthe Flowonix Prometra pump, which the patient has.  \nAdministrative approval was obtained for Pentec, the company who \nmanages patient's pump in the outpatient setting, to provide \nservices as inpatient.  Given delay in ability of pump service \nagency to provide adjustment in the inpatient setting, patient \nwas discharged with Foley catheter with plan for decrease in \nziconotide dose as an outpatient, followed by Foley removal and \nvoiding trial.\n\n#Acute pain over intrathecal pump catheter site - Developed over \nthe ___ weeks prior to admission.  CT L spine revealed no signs \nof infection.  However, where catheter bends and overlaps the L2 \nspinous process is quite superficial and had some mild \nsurrounding inflammatory stranding of the soft tissue.  Per \n___ Pain Service, this inflammation could be causing the pain. \n Pressure on the site over time from supine position (patient \nspends most of her time in bed due to debilitating pain) could \nexplain the timing of the pain 6 months after pump was placed.  \nThe pain was partially relieved by lidocaine patches. Patient \nwas discharged with lidocaine ointment and Voltaren gel.  Dr. \n___ at the ___ in ___, \nwho placed the pump, was contacted by phone on ___ regarding \nthis issue, and did not feel the catheter was causing the pain \nbut was willing to see the patient in followup.  He recommended \nthat the patient find a local pain specialist in ___ \nwho could manage the pump and the ziconotide but was unable to \nprovide a referral to a specific specialist.  ___ Pain was \nalso unable to provide this referral as the Flowonix brand of \nintrathecal pumps is essentially never used in the ___ of \n___.  Patient will contact the vendor to request a \nreferral to an appropriate local provider.  \n\n#Chronic low back pain and pelvic pain: Patient has been \ndebilitated by this pain for several years despite multiple \nprocedures. Her current narcotics are managed by Dr. ___ \n___ in ___ and her pump is managed by Dr. ___ \n___ in ___.  She was continued on her home pain regimen, \nwhich was confirmed per phone conversation with Dr. ___ on \n___, with the exception of substituting regular release \nhydromorphone for her extended release hydromorphone due to it \nbeing non-formulary at ___.\n\n#Orthostatic hypotension: Pt had been having loose stools and \ndecreased PO intake, likely due to a viral gastroenteritis.  She \nwas also on higher doses of hydromorphone at the beginning of \nthe hospitalization for acute on chronic pain.  The orthostasis \nresolved with IV fluids, weaning of narcotics, and improvement \nin her gastroenteritis.  Stool studies were negative for \ninfectious source.\n \nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n#HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued levothyroxine.\n \n#HX OF HTN\/CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA: Continued home Verapamil.\n\n#PSYCH: Continued home medications.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Patient will require routine Foley care\n- Voiding trial to be performed after intrathecal ziconotide \ndose is decreased by 20%. If no void within 8 hours, seek urgent \nmedical attention.\n- Patient will require ongoing followup with pain specialist and \nevaluation of intrathecal pump catheter incision site.\n- Patient had mild leukopenia (WBC 2.8) and anemia (Hgb ___ \nthat was stable during this admission. Consider outpatient \nworkup.\n- Consider routine periodic monitoring of CK levels while \npatient is on ziconotide.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

We believe the urinary retention was due to the recent increase in the ziconotide dose running through your pump. We were able to get administrative approval for the company who adjusts your pump settings to come provide their services in the inpatient setting, however they are able to visit you in your home to adjust the settings sooner. You will have additional nursing services to care for your new Foley catheter. Once your ziconotide dose is decreased, the Foley catheter should be removed to allow a trial of urination. If you are still unable to urinate, you should return to the hospital immediately. Our radiologists and pain specialists reviewed the CT images of your lumbar spine and we believe that the pain you are experiencing is due to the superficial placement of the pump catheter, which has some mild inflammatory changes around it. Please continue lidocaine ointment or patches and Voltaren gel to relieve the pain in that area until you can see a pain specialist who can manage this type of intrathecal pump."}

Patient had previous history of likely medication related \nhepatitis. Of note, patient denied any new risky behavior, new \nmedication or herbal supplement.  Patient underwent a right \nupper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated evidence of likely \nfatty liver, cholithiasis without cholecystitis however there \nwas no evidence portal vein thrombosis.  Liver was consulted for \nthe transamnitis and reccomended checking the patient's viral \nserologies as well as autoimmune panel. Given likely of drug \ninduced hepatitis and the multiple medications which patient is \non as an outpatient that are potential offenders discontinued \nmetformin and statin. Monitored patient's LFTs which continued \nto trend down. Other potential medications that could cause \nliver damage include colchicine and selegiline however these \nmedications were continued and LFTs improved.  Viral serologies \nall returned negative including hep A, hep B, hep C. CMV \nnegative. EBV negative for acute infection. ___ and \nantimitochondrial antibodies were negative as well.  Patient was \ndischarged off of statin and metformin.\n.\n# RUQ\/epigastric pain: The patient continues to report some \ncrampy RUQ pain that radiates to the epigastrium this AM and is \ntender to palpation.  This is most likely secondary to the \npatient's transaminitis. However, given the patient's history of \nCAD and cholelithiasis, both must be ruled out. Given that the \npain did not resolve with 2 SLNTG and a 12 hr r\/o was negative, \nACS is less likely. EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with few \npremature atrial depolarizations. Troponins were negative x3. \nRUQ US showed no evidence of gallbladder inflammation.  The \npatient also has a history of an epigastric hernia which has not \nbeen repaired and could be causing this pain.  Patient underwent \na CT abdomen\/pelvis which demonstrated no acute evidnece of \ninfection. Pain improved prior to discharge.\n.\n# fever: the patient spiked a fever to 102.1 while in the \nhospital.  The differential for fever is extensive and includes \nUTI, abdominal infection, or PNA. UA was negative, CT \nabdomen\/pelvis demonstrated no evidence of acute infection and \nCXR was also normal. Patient intially started on IV cipro\/flagyl \nwith concern for possible abdominal source which was \ndiscontinued when CT abdomen\/pelvis was unrevealing.\n.\n# CAD: patient has long history of CAD and is s\/p MI in ___ and \n5 stent placements. Epigastric pain raised concern for possible \nACS. Patient was ruled out on telemetry with negative enzymes \nx3. Telemetry was notable only for irregular heart rate. Statin \nwas held on admission and discharge. Patient was continued on \naspirin and beta blocker. Defer to PCP as to choice for possible \noutpatient anti-lipid agent.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: patient is maintained as outpatient on \ncoumadin. Initial INR on admission was 3.1 so coumadin was held \nespecially in the setting of possible liver dysfunction.  INR \nwas restarted once LFTs improved and INR actually became \nsubtherapeutic likely due to patient being off medication for \none day. Patient was discharged on his home regimen of coumadin \nand told to continue routine follow-up as previously set up with \ngoal INR ___ for atrial fibrillation\n.\n# HTN: Patient was continued on outpatient regimen with good \nhypertensive control.\n.\n# DM: maintained on metformin as outpatient without insulin \nsliding scale.  Metformin was held and patient was started on \ninsulin sliding scale in house. Given desire not to restart \nmetformin, patient was started on oral glipizide at a low dose \n2.5 mg PO Daily with goal to uptitrate as an outpatient. ___ in \nhouse were 100-200s. Patient also advised to use glucometer to \ncheck ___ given that regimen had changed and to keep a long to \ngive to his PCP.\n.\n# R hip pain: patient continues to complain of pain in the R \nhip\/lower back area.  This is most likely due to OA.  Patient is \ns\/p R hip replacement with revision. Patient was managed with \npain control\n.\n# FEN: cardiac\/diabetic diet, replete electrolytes prn\n.\n#PPx: on coumadin, bowel regimen prn\n.\n#Access: PIV\n.\n#Contact: with patient\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nATORVASTATIN 40 mg once a day  \nCOLCHICINE 0.6 mg Tablet - once a day  \nCYCLOBENZAPRINE - 10 mg Tablet three times a day prn back pain  \nISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE 30 mg- 0.5 Tablet(s) by mouth DAILY  \nMETFORMIN 500 mg Tablet one in AM and two tablets in ___  \nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE 50 mg once a day  \nSELEGILINE HCL 5 mg DAILY  \nVALSARTAN 80 mg Tablet DAILY  \nWARFARIN 2.5 mg M\/Thm, 5 mg Tablet all other days  \nASCORBIC ACID ___ mg Tablet daily  \nASPIRIN 81 mg Tablet once a day  \nLupron - last 12 week injection ___  \ntopical lidocaine (20% cream) with ?tylenol in it also.  \nclaritin OTC prn - started 6 weeks ago.  \nVitamin B12 injections, last ___ weeks ago  \nNo herbal supplements  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Your viral serologies were negative so it was felt to be mots likely secondary to medications. Your liver function tests improved off of these medications. We tested you for mononucleosis. It appears that you have previously been exposed to this infection but that there is no current active infection. Your CMV virus was also negative. You were also noted to have a fever and underwent an extensive work-up including blood cultures, urine culture, chest x-ray and CT scan of abdomen\/pelvis which did not show any source for infection. Your fever subsided. We would reccomend that you eat a low tyramine diet given that you are on selegiline which is an MAOI inhibitor in addition to a heart healthy, diabetic diet. We would also reccomend that you check your fingersticks at home three times a day and bring this record with you to your primary care doctor as we are changing your diabetic regimen around."}

Ruptured ___ \ncyst. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old man with afib (previously on \ndabigitran) and recent GI bleed with no source identified on \nendoscopy or colonoscopy from ___, who presented \nfrom clinic with a left lower extremity DVT and is now s\/p IVC \nfilter placement.  \n \n# Left gastroc DVT: He was evaluated during a routine \nappointment with his cardiologist where  on review of systems he \nendorsed left lower extremity pain and was sent to the ED where \nhe was found to have a left gastroc DVT by ultrasound.  It is \nunclear if unprovoked or provoked. During his recent \nhospitalization for GI bleed (below) he went without heparin SQ \nor DVT prophylaxis, but he was ambulating multiple times daily.  \nIn the ED was started on heparin drip. Given his recent GI bleed \nwith unclear source, the decision was made to place an IVC \nfilter as anticoagulation would put him at risk of continued \nbleed. IVC filter was placed on ___, and patient was set up \nwith follow up with Dr. ___ will coordinate the \nremoval of the filter in 3 months.  Because he was over ___ and \nthis was his first clot and he has no FH of clots, a \nhypercoaguable workup was not done in the hospital. Our concern, \nhowever, is that he may have an irreversible etiology for his \nDVT, such as a malignancy, especially in the setting of this GI \nbleed. He was given instructions to follow up with his PCP who \nwill provide a referral for hematology follow up with Dr. ___ \n___ or colleagues to further investigate a possible \nhypercoagulable state. \n   \n# Recent GI bleed: Mr. ___ was recently admitted to \n___ for a GI bleed while on Pradaxa.  During that \nhospitalization (4 days total), he received 4 units PRBCs, EGD, \ncolonoscopy, and a failed capsule endoscopy (did not make it to \nsmall bowel). ___ showed mild distal esophagitis, hiatal \nhernia, single tiny possible early ___ lesion and friability \nof the duodenal bulb. There was no obvious source of bleeding \nfound.  His dabigitran was discontinued during that admission \n(approximately two weeks prior to current admission).  His last \nbloody bowel movement was 4 days prior to admission and he \nremained guaiac negative throughout hospitalization. Two large \nbore peripheral IVs were placed, an active type and screen was \nmaintained and HCT was checked Q12H, which remained stable. He \nwas started on iron at his prior hospitalization and that was \ncontinued.   \n  \n# Atrial fibrillation: He is currently in normal sinus rhythm \nwithout any perceptible episodes of afib since ___ \nwhen he was started on metoprolol. Metoprolow was continued \nduring hospitalization with holding parameters.  His Pradaxa was \ndiscontinued on prior hospitalization, but there was ongoing \ndiscussion of anticoagulation risks\/benefits (CHADS 0 vs 2 with \n? TIA) given this recent GI bleed.  Likely he should avoid \ndabigitran, but depending on the opinions of his outpatient \ngastroenterologist and cardiologist, his case may warrant trial \nof daily aspirin vs. coumadin in future. \n \n# CODE STATUS: FULL confirmed  \n \n# EMERGENCY CONTACT: friend ___ (patient would like \nher to be his HCP although needs to fill out paperwork)  \n \n# Transitional issues: \n- Patient was scheduled with follow up appointment with PCP to \narrange referrals for hematology with Dr. ___ or \ncolleagues for workup of ? unprovoked DVT, cardiology with Dr. \n___ IVC filter retrieval, and GI for possible \nre-scoping to find source of bleeding. \n- Patient will need IVC filter removal in 3 months from \ndischarge (appointment scheduled with Dr. ___ in 1 month. \n\n- Patient will need cancer screening given possibly unprovoked \nDVT.\n- Patient will need to discuss with PCP and cardiologist the \nneed for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation going forward. \nHe was dischared on no form of anticoagulation given recent \nbleed. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1.

Moderate right ventricular \ndilation,\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old gentleman with PMH including CAD s\/p stenting,  dual \nchamber ICD, CHF LVEF of 40% mod MR, TR (___), atrial \ntach\/fib on coumadin, s\/p chemo + Rad + left coloectomy for \nrectal CA, h\/o upper GIB from duodenal ectazia who was reffered \nby his PCP due to progressive fatigue and ___ Hct.\n.\n# Anemia: Mr. ___ had slowly ___ Hct prior to \nhis admission w\/o overt bleeding. On admission found to have \nmicrocytic anemia with Hct 24.7 and Retic. Index of 1.1%. \nThought to be multifactorial d\/t iron deficiency, CRF, Chronic \ndisease. Concern for hemolysis was also raised (See \"Jaundice\" \nbelow). B12 and Folate were not deficient. Iron was low with \nFerrittin at low end of normal range. He was hemodynamically \nstable throught his stay. Despite guiac negative stools history \nwas concerning for potential sources of GI bleed including  s\/p \nUGIB from duodenal ectasia and s\/p rectal cancer. He underwent \nEGD which was normal. The patient declined colonoscopy at this \ntime. Celiac serology was negative. He recieved a total of 3 \nunits of PRBC. Hct at discharge was 30.4 His coumadin was \ncontinued as he did not have signs of major bleeding. Omeprazole \ndose was reduced from 40mg BID to 20mg QD per normal EGD. Iron \nsupplementation was started. He will require close monitoring of \nhis Hct in the out-patient setting and further anemia workup \nincluding outpatient colonoscopy, UPEP, SPEP as well as \nhematology consultation for possible hemolysis. \n.\n# CHF exacerbation. Mr. ___ has dilated cardiomyopathy \nwith EF 40% per echo ___. He was clinically fluid overoladed on \nadmission, likely ___ to decompensated HF in the setting of \nanemia. He was kept on his home doses of PO furosamide and \nrecieved adittional IV furosamide dosing as well as PRBC for his \nanemia. Lisinopril, spironolacton and Metoprolol were continued. \nHe had good urine output with this and his fluid status \nsignificantly improved to euvolumia at discharge. He will \ncontinue to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist.  \n.\n# Jaundice: The patient was noticed to be Jaundiced and was \nfound to have hyperbilirubinemia. Urobiilnogen + spoke against \nobstructive process. Raised LDH++ was concerning for hemolysis, \nbut haptoglobin was normal and direct and indirect coombs \ntesting was negative, no schistocytes were noted on smear. He \ndoes have chronic transamintis which is thought to be due to \ncongested liver ___ to right heart failure. Worsening of liver \ncongestion in the setting of decompensated heart failure may be \nthe underlying cause of Jaundice. ___ syndrome is unlikely \nas he has no history of prior episodes of Jaundice. Trending of \nLFT's and further work-up should continue in the out-patient \nsetting. Hematology consultation was arranged for work-up of \npossible hemolysis.   \n.\n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Admission Cr 1.7 up from 1.3 \nat baseline, likely pre-renal failure in the setting of \ndecompensated heart failure. Cr subsequently trended down to \nbase-line with treatment of HF. Renal functions should be \nfollowed up in the out-patient setting. \n\n# Fever: Mr. ___ had a ___ temprature spike \nduring a blood transfusion. Work-up for transfusion reaction was \nnot concerning. Blood cultures were so far negative. He did have \na cough but CXR was not concerning for pneumonia. UA was \nnegative. He subsequently remained afebrile and had no \nleukocytosis. \n.  \n# Atrial Fibrillation: patient is paced by dual chamber ICD. \nRate control with BB and anticoagulatation with Warfaine were \ncontinued. His INR on discharge was 1.7. He will continue INR \nmonitoring and warfarin dose adjustment in the out-patient \nsetting.  \n. \n# CAD: Patient is s\/p stenting of the OM in ___ following \ncardiac arrest; His home medication regimen does not include \naspirin and statin. He will continue follow up with his \nout-patient cardiologist. Initiation of aspirin and statin for \nseondary prevention should be considered. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n- lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily\n- warfarin PO 1mg TTSS, ___ MWF\n- CPAP - prescribed but doesn't use it\n- toprol XL 25mg PO daily\n- triamcinolone cream applied topically BID to legs\n- omeprazole 40mg PO BID\n- lasix 60mg PO BID\n- spironolactone 25mg PO daily\n- KCL ___ daily\n\n.  \nAllergies:  \n- penicillin\n- streptomycin\n- erythromycin\n- auriomycin\n- atenolol\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \nmmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The \nleft ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe \nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %). The \nestimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L\/min\/m2). No masses \nor thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular \ncavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall \nhypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and \narch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral \nvalve leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to \nsevere tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right \natrial pressure.] There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe right ventricle is dilated with greater tricuspid \nregurgitation and higher estimated pulmonary arterial pressure. \nThe appearance of the left ventricle is similar.   \n\n___ ECG\nVentricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing no \nchange. \n\n___ CXR FINDINGS:  \nLeft-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the \nregions of the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, \nunchanged.  Severe \ncardiomegaly is again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are \nunchanged.  No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  No focal \nconsolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  \nAtelectasis is noted in both lung bases.  There are no acute \nosseous abnormalities. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \nSevere cardiomegaly without congestive heart failure or \npneumonia. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y\/o M with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction(EF \n___, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, attributed to an \nanti-psychotic medication, mild pulmonary hypertension, ___ MR \nand TR, and CKD with baseline ___ creatinine, and ICD who \npresented with weakness and dyspnea. \n\n# Acute on Chronic Decompensated Heart Failure  \nUpon arrival patient appeared hypervolemic based on JVP exam, \nthe rest of the exam was not remarkable for hypervolemia \n(minimal pedal edema, lungs without major crackles). BNP was \nelevated to 30k from baseline 15k. He also had leukocytosis, \ntransaminitis, and ___ on CKD. Patient was diuresed with IV \nlasix 200mg BID boluses with net fluid loss daily. After \ndiuresis, patient's lab abnormalities improved and he returned \nto baselinine renal function, leukocytosis resolved and liver \nenzymes were downtrending. A repeat cardiac echo showed a LVEF \n___ and compared to echo from ___ the right ventricle is \ndilated with greater tricuspid regurgitation and higher \nestimated pulmonary arterial pressure.  Patient was started on \nhydralazine for afterload reduction given heart failure. EP was \nconsulted to check for arrhythmias that could have precipitated \nexacerbation of CHF, but nothing substantial was found. Of note, \npatient's ICD is no longer BiV paced since ___ given chest wall \nstimulation. Also in ___ LV lead could not be replaced d\/t \nanatomic structure. Upon discharge patient was on 100 mg \ntorsemide daily with a return to baseline of his symptoms. He \noccasionally had short runs of asymptomatic non-sustained \nventricular tachycardia. Discharge weight: 73.1kg. \n\n#Mitral Regurgiation\/TR - severe MR and mod\/sev TR. Will benefit \nfrom afterload reduction. Started on hydralazine 10mg TID in \naddition to isordil.\n\n# Transaminitis  \nALT\/AST to 300s with mild elevation of Tbili to 2.2 on \nadmission. Normal RUQ U\/S reported at OSH without evidence of \nobstruction. Mild liver heterogenetity. Trace ascites. \nCoagulopathy initially with INR of 1.1 at discharge. Most likely \ncongestive hepatopathy that improved with diuresis. Labwork for \nhepatitis A,B,C and HIV was negative. \n \n#Leukocytosis on presentation. Infectious work-up was negative. \nResolved with diuresis. Most likely cause was CHF exacerbation. \n\n# Acute on chronic kidney disease  \nSignificantly elevated from prior baseline 1.7-2.2. Creatinine \n3.2 on admission. Most likely a reflection of cardiorenal \nprocess with CHF exacerbation. Resolved with diuresis with Cr \n1.6 at discharge. Of note, has only R kidney per abdominal US \nthough patient does not remember. Had RCC of the other kidney. \nUA with urine lytes unremarkable. \n\n#Fe Deficiency Anemia. TIBC borderline normal\/high. Low Iron, \nlow ferritin. Most likely iron def anemia. B12 high.Patient was \nanemic on admission and iron studies were consistent with iron \ndeficiency. His iron was repleted with iron gluconate.\n\n#Schizophrenia - was well controlled on home medications during \nhospitalization.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n#Discharge weight: 73.1kg\n#Patient is Hepatitis B surface antibody negative - consider \nvaccination as an outpatient. \n#Transaminitis - f\/u to check for resolution. Most likely cause \nwas congestive hepatopathy from CHF. If not resolved consider \nfurther workup. \n#Iron deficiency anemia - check for improving hemoglobin and \nfurther iron administration\/work-up if not improving. Make sure \npatient is up to date on colon cancer screening.\n#started on hydralazine for afterload reduction.

It was believed the abdominal pain came about \nsecondary to constipation and abdominal distention. The patient \nwas given an aggressive bowel regimen, which helped the symptoms \nwhich we believe were secondary to a previous botox injection \nfor pelvic floor disfunction. The patient also received her \nsecond loading dose of Humira while in the hospital and was \nstarted on a course of steroids (initially IV to PO prednisone). \nHer abdominal pain and distension continued to improve and was \nat baseline at discharge.\n\nThroughout the hospitalization, the patient also had continued \nhypoxia, which was something she had experienced at a recent \nhospitalization at ___, but without any clear reason. \nThe patient required ___ of oxygen for the first half of her \nstay to remain in the low ___ on her O2 stat and would desat \ninto the high ___ and low ___ during ambulation. Outside records \ncould not be gathered regarding any hypoxia. It was believe this \nwas caused by a raised right hemidiaphragm causing low lung \nvolumes, atlectosis from laying in bed, and blunting secondary \nto abdominal pain. The patient was also found to have a \npneumonia (CAP) which was treated for 5 days with levaquin. \nUltimately, once the patient began ambulating and her abdominal \npain improved she was able to come of all O2 without difficulty \nand did not require home oxygen.\n\nThe patient was also found to have leukocytosis on admission \nwhich reached a nadir of 10 during the middle of the \nhospitalization when the patient felt well, however began to \nrise without a clear cause. The WBC went up to 23.9 and \nstabilized around this value, and although the patient had been \nstarted on steroids, was a suspicious rise in the context of her \nclinical picture. A blood smear was obtained which showed \ninflammation, B12 deficiency, and some questionable MDS type \ncells. The patients B12 was found to be low at 224, but an MMA \nwas not obtained as it an outpatient lab. To evaluate for other \npotential causes of leukocytosis, a CT abdomin\/pelvis was done \nto evaluate for potential abscess\/occult infection, and revealed \na wedge-shaped infarct in a peripheral region of her liver. To \nfurther classify this and to look for any local process which \ncould have contributed, a MRI liver was done which did not \ndemonstrate the lesion and heme\/onc did not recommend \nanticoagulation. The patient was discharged home in stable \ncondition.\n\n=======================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=======================\n[]Check CBC in 1 week to evaluate improving leukocytosis. If \ncontinues to be elevated, consider heme\/onc referral for \npossible bone marrow biopsy for MDS ___\n[]Vitamin B12 was deficient.

Intubation appeared to have precipitated \nhypotension, possibly ___ setting of pHTN (suggested on CTA). \nCardiogenic shock was also on the differential given question of \nischemic changes on EKG. Trops however were stable at ~0.04 and \nCK-MB remained flat. Neurogenic shock unlikely despite initial \nquestion of seizures given no seizure activity on EEG and no \nacute process on CT head. Patient was fluid resuscitated and \ntreated with antibiotics allowing him to clinically improve and \nbe weaned from pressors. \n\n# Respiratory Failure\/PNA:\nPt presented with hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory failure. No \nevidence of PE on CTA; ACS ruled out. Lung process thought \nlikely septic pneumonia complicated by COPD, although no \nevidence of COPD exacerbation on vent (see below). CT chest \nrevealed near-complete collapse of entire right lung secondary \nto mucus plugging of the R mainstem bronchus, as well as \nenlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pHTN, pointing to \nother contributors to respiratory failure. On follow-up \nbronchoscopy, copius purulent secretions were suctioned from the \nR lung; Multi lobar collapse possibly secondary to severe PNA \nvs. malignancy (there is a note of RUL lung mass ___ record). Pt \nwas started on vancomycin\/zosyn\/azithromycin. Sputum cultures X2 \ngrew klebsiella sensitive to zosyn and MRSA screen was negative \ntherefor pt was narrowed to zosyn monotherapy. Pt was maintained \non the vent and treated with nebulizers, and initially failed to \nimprove: he was difficult to sedate, becoming alternatively \napneic and unresponsive and agitated on fent\/versed. On ___ he \nself-extubated but immediately became hypopneic and sedated and \nrequired ventilatory support with a bag-valve mask until he \ncould be reintubated. Gradually his respiratory status improved, \nand by ___ he was weaned to pressure support. Discussions had \nbeen underway regarding trach, which patient had undergone ___ \nthe past. The decision was made that since he was on minimal \nvent settings, he would be given a trial of extubation, but \ngiven his volatile respiratory status the team would be ready to \nreintubate quickly if extubation was unsuccessful, with a plan \nfor trach\/peg the following day. Pt was extubated successfully \non ___, with no respiratory decompensation. By ___ he was alert \nand oriented, breathing comfortably, and was transferred to the \nfloor. Thereafter, he maintained O2 saturations via nasal \ncannula, while finishing course of IV ABX for PNA (Klebsiella \nsensitive to Zosyn). Pt finished 10 day course of Zosyn on ___. \nCXR on ___ showed no interval improvement since ___, w\/ \nunchanged RLL opacification. ___ speaking w\/ pulm consult \nservice, it was thought that pt would likely need time to \nrecover fxn of that lobe. Accordingly, he was given outpatient \npulmonary f\/u appt to have such issue re-addressed, as well as \npHTN evaluated, and lung nodule re-imaged. \n\n# AMS\/Delerium:\nOn admission, pt presented ___ acute confusional state, thought \nlikely to be ___ toxic metabolic encephalopathy. No evidence of \nseizure on EEG. CT head and MRA head both without acute \nprocesses. Pt was intermittently agitated and nearly-obtunded on \nsedation for ventilation, and was started on seroquel QHS. He \nwas successfully extubated on ___, and became alert and oriented \nwithin 24 hours. He remained AOx3 thereafter without incident. \n\n# Hyperkalemia:\nPt presented with a K+ of 7.7, not hemolyzed. He had presented \non multiple prior occasions with hyperkalemia of unclear \netiology. Differential included RTA vs. ___. No e\/o rhabdo, CK \nnormal. No peaked Ts on EKG. Pt given kayexelate, Insulin+D5W, \nand his K resolved and remained stable thereafter. \n\n# ST Depressions: \nOn admission, pt had ST depressions on EKG ___ V1-V3 concerning \nfor ischemia; no prior EKG available for comparison. However his \ntrop and ___ remained flat. TTE showed EF >50%, severe \npulmonary hypertension but no evidence of focal wall motion \nabnormality or systolic dysfunction. \n\n# COPD: \nStatus of pt's COPD not clear. No evidence of exacerbation at \npresent. Low auto-PEEP and nearly normal peak pressures on vent. \nInvestigation into OSH records revealed pt does not have a \npulmonologist and appears not to have undergone pulmonary \nfunction testing; COPD was a presumed diagnosis given difficulty \nweaning from vent ___ the past. Pt was continued on \ntiotropium\/albuterol nebs; however steroids for COPD \nexacerbation were not initiated. Prior to discharge, pt was \nrestarted on outpatient regimen of Advair and Tiotropium. Since \nIpratropium seemed to be a redundant medication, it was \ndiscontinued on discharge. Pt was given outpatient pulmonary f\/u \nappt to have PFTs done, regimen evaluated, pHTN evaluated, and \nlung nodule re-imaged. \n\n#Pulmonary HTN:\nGiven findings on TTE and CTA, severe pHTN was thought to \nrepresent the patient's primary chronic respiratory issue rather \nthan COPD. Etiology of pHTN likely chronic OSA given pt's \nhabitus. Thus, it was felt that pt could benefit from and R \nheart catheterization ___ future. Accordingly, he was provided \nwith a pulmonary f\/u appt where such test can be scheduled. \n\n#Guiac +, Maroon Streaked Stool\n___ the ICU, pt was noted to have guiac positive stool, not on \nanticoagulation, but Hct remained stable throughout. On \nadmission to the medicine floor, nurses noted that pt had maroon \ncolored blood swirled into soft brown stool. Pt had hx of \nrectosigmoid ca s\/p XRT\/Chemo so could possible represent \nanastamotic issues, radiation proctitis, recurrent malignancy or \nmore likely gastritis, or gastric ulcer from critical illness \nand intubation. Pt was without elevated coags or abnormalities \n___ platelets. His Hct was trended and remained stable. He was \ncontinued on a PPI and did not require blood transfusions. \nHowever, he will need outpatient gastroenterology follow up to \nhave colonoscopy\/endoscopy evaluation. \n\n# Hypothyroidsim:\nLevothyroxine continued. \n\n# ___ on CKD:\nCr baseline is 1.4, of unknown etiology. Increased to max of 2.3 \non ___, likely ___ aggressive diuresis given elevated bicarb and \ndry MM on exam. Pt given 250cc boluses, and lasix held \nthereafter, causing Cr to downtrend to baseline prior to \ndischarge.  \n\n# HTN:\nPt hypotensive on arrival, antihypertensives held. Occasionally \nwould become hypertensive to 160s when agitated on the vent, but \nrequired no interventions. By time of discharge, pt was \nrestarted on home dose metoprolol XL. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===============================================\n1. Pt was given outpatient pulmonary f\/u appt to have PFTs done, \nCOPD regimen evaluated, pHTN evaluated, lung nodule re-imaged, \nand for discussion of possible therapy w\/ intention to re-expand \nchronically collapsed right lower lobe of lung\n2. Pt had a R lung nodule identified w\/ mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy on CT scan and it is recommended that he have \nrepeat CT Chest as outpatient after pneumonia clears to better \ncharacterize lesion.\n3. Pt needs outpatient follow up with Urology for hypospadia\n4. Pt should follow up with ___ provider for general \nhealth care maintenance\n5. Pt would benefit from continued physical\/occupational therapy \nto recover from profound deconditioning\n6. Pt was found to have Guiac positive stool, thought to be ___ \ngastritis, but will need to be evaluated as an outpatient by \ngastroenterologist with endoscopy and colonoscopy.\n7.

Pt was initially imaged with CXR and followed \nup with CT scan which showed infectious process with mucous \nplugging and no evidence of progressed malignancy causing \nobstruction. Pt was ruled out for flu and increased cough when \nsupine was thought to be more due to aspiration than CHF given \nno other clinical finding of fluid overload. Pt had failed \nazithromycin x 10 days as an outpt and was started on \nCeftriaxone and Flagyl. Pt did not receive 2 doses of \nCeftriaxone for unclear reasons without the primary team being \nnotified and was quickly restarted once error identified. During \nthis time, pt was febrile and sympomatically hypotensive, \nconcerning for sepsis. She responded well to 500ml bolus of IVF \nand blood cultures remained negative. Pt was also treated with \nstanding nebs, aggressive chest physical therapy and insentive \nspirometry. On discharge, pt was switched to oral regimen for \nanother 12 days (Flagyl and Cefpodoxime) as well as prescribed \ninhaler treatments given her symptomatic improvement to nebs. \n\nRegarding pt's aspiration and swallowing ability, pt underwent \nvideo swallow study which confirmed pt's ability to prevent \naspiration with a strong cough.

No evidence of malignancy flair \ncontributing to current presentation. She was continued on \nlevothyroxine and PET scan will be done as an outpt once \ninfectious is resolved.  \nCT finding of pulm nodules and vertebral abnormalities can also \nbe evaluated by repeat imaging once infection cleared.\n\n# Hypocalcemia: Pt found to be hypocalcemic to 7.8 with ionized \ncalcium 1.04. She was repleted with IV calcium as well as \nincreased oral calcium and vitamin D. The cause of hypocalcemia \nwas unclear. PTH 67, Vit D and Calcitonin pending at time of \ndischrage. \n\n# Goals of care: Pt expressed exhaustion and frustration with \nongoing illness and recurrent admissions.

New myocardial \ndefects in the inferior wall and the infero-apical wall, both \nareas with partial reversibility. These findings are new from \n___. 2. Global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 35%. \n.\nCXR ___ - IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema. \n.\nCardiac cath ___\nCOMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right \ndominant \nsystem demonstrated two-vessel disease.  The LMCA had a \nproximal, focal, \ncalcified 20% stenosis.  The LAD had proximal stenosis to 30% \nand \ndiffuse disease throughout.  The mid and distal LAD had serial \nfocal \nmoderate lesions before it completely occluded just before the \napex. \nThe apical LAD is occluded (appears to have been a wrap-around \nvessel) \nand fills via faint collaterals from L-R and R-L.   A large, \nbifurcating \nD1 (functionally ramus intermedius+diagonal) is free from \nobstructive \ndisease.  The D2 is a smaller vessel and had a ___ proximal \nlesion. \nThe LCx is free from angiographically apparent disease. Overall, \nit is a \nsmaller system with a diminutive AV groove segment and sizable \nsingle OM \nthat tapers distally.  The RCA has mild disease throughout.  The \nR-PDA \nmarkedly tapers distally and so does the long (reaches the apex) \ndistal \npole branch of the AM. \n2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated \nright-sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 16 mmHg.   The \nwedge \npressure was also markedly elevated with a mean of 30 mmHg.  \nThere was \nmoderate pulmonary hypertension with a PASP of 56 mmHg.  The \ncardiac \nindex was decreased at 2.0 L\/min\/m2.  There were prominent V \nwaves on \nwedge tracing suggesting significant mitral regurgitation. \n  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. \n3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. \n4. Low cardiac index. \n5. Significant mitral regurgitation. \n.\nTransthoracic echo ___\nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are \nnormal. The left ventricular cavity size is top \nnormal\/borderline dilated. There is probably mild to moderate \nregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior \nakinesis and inferoseptal and inferolateral hypokinesis. \nEstimated left ventricular ejection fraction is ?___re suboptimal for this assessment. [Intrinsic left \nventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the \nseverity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal (views suboptimal). The \naortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are \nmildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no \npericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nleft ventricular systolic function now appears less vigorous and \nheart rate is now slower (nondysfunctional segments are now less \nhyperdynamic). Mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent.  \n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old female with past medical history \nsignificant for coronary artery disease, congestive heart \nfailure (diastolic dysfunction, last EF=40% at ___, \ndiabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation was admitted on \n___ with chest pain and an abnormal stress test consistent \nwith unstable angina. \n.\n#. Unstable angina- Patient presented to ___ with chest pain. \nIn the emergency department (ED) she received nitroglycerin \nwhich helped resolve the pain.  Troponins were (-). An ECG was \ndone showing L axis deviation and RBBB.  A CXR showed pulmonary \nedema for which the patient received 40mg IV lasix.

There \nis no hydronephrosis. Tiny calcific crystals in the kidneys \nbilaterally are unchanged. No masses are identified. The urinary \nbladder is within normal limits. \nIMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ yo F with history of rheumatic fever s\/p \nmitral valve replacement who presents with atypical chest pain \nafter recent diagnosis with MSSA endocarditis.\n\n# Atypical chest pain \/ GERD: Patient has history of \nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse, which place her \nat risk for cardiac events. However, onset of symptoms at rest, \nduration of symptoms (hours), unchanged EKG and negative x3 \ncardiac enzymes were not suggestive of cardiac etiology. She \nalso had concurrent epigastric burning and choking sensation in \nher throat that suggested a GI source. The pain was partially \nrelieved with GI cocktail (ranitidine, pantoprazole, maalox).  \nShe had several more episodes of similar chest pain that were \nimproved by maalox or GI cocktail.  She was started on a PPI and \nthen this was increased to BID. She still occaisionally had this \ndiscomfort. We also started her on simethicone. The time course \nand the fact that it was sometimes releived with passing flatus \nmade it also fit with gas and bloating and it was explained to \nher that the alterations in her gut flora and the efffects of \nthe antibiotics may mean that she has some abdominal\/epigastric \ndiscomfort until she is done her course. Being back on \nprobiotics when at rehab might help.\n  \n# Status post mitral valve replacement - The patient's INR was \nsubtherapeutic on admission at 1.6.  She was placed on a heparin \ngtt and her coumadin dose was increased.  Lovenox was avoided \ngiven the new renal failure.  Her INR eventually increased back \ninto the therapeutic range.  She should have her INR monitored \nat rehab with a goal of 2.5 - 3.5, and her coumadin dose \nadjusted as needed. Importantly, her INR is bound to change when \nshe has finished her rifampin. Phamrmacy posited that she might \neven stablize at 2.5 mg coumadin when it is stopped. They \nrecommended halving the dose  of coumadin and monitoring INR \nvery closely until stable.\n  \n# Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine was 1.7 on \nadmission, increased from baseline of 0.9 - 1.2.  FENa > 2%.  \nUrine eos negative.  Urine ultrasound and UA otherwise \nunremarkable.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended an \ninfectious disease consult to help with antibiotic reassessment. \nThere were no muddy brown casts to suggest ATN and even though \nthere was no urine eosinophils, the picture generally fit with \nAIN, Her naficillin was switched to cefazolin.   Her renal \nfunction improved slightly while hospitalized.  She should have \nher creatinine monitored at rehab and if it rises greater than \n1.8, her nephrologist, Dr. ___ be contacted.  The \npatient has nephrology follow-up as below.\n  \n# MSSA endocarditis - The patient was continued on rifampin and \nnafcillin and then naficillin was switched to cefazolin.  Her \nCBC w\/ diff, Bu\/Cr\/ LFT's labs should be monitored at rehab \nevery ___ and sent to ___ clinic at ___. All laboratory \nresults should be faxed to Infectious disease R.Ns. at ___. All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics should \nbe directed to the infectious disease R.Ns. at ___ or \nto on call MD in when clinic is closed. She has ID and \ncardiology follow-up scheduled.\n \n# Diarrhea - The patient was complaining of diarrhea since her \nprevious hospital discharge. Stool test for C. difficile was \nnegative. Diarrhea is likely secondary to antibiotic therapy.\n\n# Palmar rash- The patient came in with an erythematous pruritic \nrash on bilateral palms. The rash worsened a bit during the \nhospitalization and extended into the interdigital spaces. It is \nmost likely a drug reaction, given its morbilliform appearance, \nthough eczema cannot be excluded. Topical hydrocortisone and \nsarna lotion were given.\n  \n# Anemia - Monitored, stable.  Haptoglobin < 5, LDH elevated, \nlikely hemolysis from mechanical mitral valve.\n  \n# Hypertension - BP monitored, stable.  Continued on prior \nregimen\n\n# Back pain - The patient had intermittant low back pain during \nher hospitalization.  Her hematocrit remained stable.

You were given heparin and continued on warfarin until your INR reached 2.5, which is a good level for your mechanical valve. While you were in the hospital, you underwent an ultrasound of your kidneys because your kidney function decreased. The kidney and infectious disease doctors believed your brief kidney injury was due to one of the antibiotics you were receiving for endocarditis that has now been stopped. Your kidney function was improving when you were discharged. Your stool was tested for bacteria that can cause diarrhea and it was negative. Your diarrhea is likely due to the antibiotics and should get better when the antibiotics are stopped."}

Unclear trigger for current flare on admission. \nPrior to admission patient was on prednisone recently increased \nfrom 5 to 10mg) and infliximab. GI was consulted and patient was \nstarted on Augmentin per GI due to history of ___ \nabscess. Patient was initially treated with IV steroids, po \naugmentin, and bowel rest. Her bowel was imaged with an MRE \nwhich demonstrated pancolitis. Attempts to advance her diet \nresulted in bloody diarrhea requiring blood transfusion and \nwhich was concerning for persistent steroid refractory disease \nversus alternative bleeding source. Additional imaging was thus \nperformed that demonstrated persistent disease despite treatment \nwith IV steroids, po augmentin, and bowel rest. Patient was \nrecommended to undergo total colectomy but refused due to \npossibility of permanent ileostomy. She was amenable to IV \ncyclosporine and was treated with it from ___ before \ntransitioning to po cyclosporine that was continued upon \ndischarge. At the time of her discharge her IV methylprednisone \nwas changed to po prednisone. During her hospital stay she was \nvery briefly placed on TPN (___) due to her prolonged low \ndietary intake in the setting of bowel rest, but was able to \nadvance to BRAT diet with IV cyclosporine initiation and was \nadvised to advance her diet as tolerated at the time of \ndischarge. Given the multiple immunosuppressing regimens the \npatient was on, she was also started on bactrim for PCP \nprophylaxis during this hospital stay which was continued at \ndischarge. \n\nUnclear trigger for this flare, although pt reports more recent \nstress in setting of starting new BA \n-Pneumoboots + TEDs, previously counseled patient on importance \nof using SCDs and additionally encouraged ambulation during the \nday, particularly given her increased risk of thromboembolism \ndue to Crohn's.

No \nlocalizing infectious symptoms, and fever resolved. Has \nreportedly had history of liver cyts which were again \ndemonstrated on RUQ US without RUQ tenderness to palpation, thus \nnot believed to be the source of intermittent fevers. The \npatient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was treated for \npresumed community acquired pneumonia given her subjective \nsymptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion on \nadmission CXR without obvious localizing infectious signs, clear \nV\/Q scan, and negative urine and blood cultures at the time of \ndischarge.\n\n# CP: The patient had an admission EKG and troponins reassuring \nfor ACS, but reported pleuritic chest pain on admission.  Given \na sub-therapeutic INR the patient was begun on a heparin drip, \nand with a recent history of travel and elevated d-dimer a V\/Q \nscan was ordered which showed low probability of a pullmonary \nembolism. The patient's chest pain resolved completely by \nhospital day 2.

Etiology of rhabdomyolosis, considered as a sequelae \nof recent bike accident and concaine use. The possibility of \ncompartment syndrome was considered, however, physical exam was \nnot c\/w this diagnosis. Also on differential was HIV given his \nrisk factors and erlichiosis given that he is from the ___ (but \nparasite smear at OSH negative and pt does not recall tick \nbite). Pt was given aggressive fluid repletion initially with NS \nand then with ___ NS c 1.5 amps bicarb. Pt's bicarb was followed \nto ensure that metabolic acidosis was not entirely corrected (as \nmetabolic acidosis is protective for hypocalcemic seizures both \nby raising seizure threshold and by decreasing the fraction of \ncalcium bound to albumin). Pt's electrolytes were trended. Pt \nwas significantly hypocalcemic but without symptoms. The calcium \nwas not repleted as it was felt that pt would soon become \nsignificantly hypercalcemic ___ lysis of muscle cells. CK and \nuric acid were also trended and they slowly trended down. IVF \nwere eventually discontinued secondary to pt's poor urine output \nand increasing volume overload. HIV and Hepatits serologies were \nnegative.  Upon transfer to the floor, he continued improve with \nintermittent HD and fluid support.  His CK trended down and he \ndid well.\n  \nAcute Renal Failure: Initial differential consists of \nrhabdomyolysis, DIC, TTP-HUS, severe babesiosis (given ___ \n___ location). Renal was consulted and felt that this \npresentation was typical of ATN ___ rhabdomyolysis. ___ labs \nwere negative as was parasite smear. Pt recieved aggressive \nfluid hydration as above. Pt's renal function did not improve \nover initial several days in MICU, pt was thus started on \nhemodialysis on HD.  He improved after 2 rounds of HD and \ncontinued to mobilize fluids.  His creatinine plateaued in the \nmid-___, with good urine output.  He was able to void on his own \nwithout any issues.\n \nAcute hepatitis: Patient initially presented with transaminitis \nwith initial differential including rhabdomyolosis (ALT and AST \nfrom muscle source rather than liver), hepatitis B\/C given \npolysubstance abuse history, severe babesiosis, acetaminophen \ntoxicity and alcoholic hepatitis (unlikely as tox screen was \nnegative). Hepatitis B and C serologies were consistent only \nwith prior hepatitis B vaccination. RUQ u\/s was unremarkable for \nliver process and parasite smear was negative for babesiosis x2 \n(OSH and here).  As he improved, his LFT's returned to normal. \n\nRight upper extremity DVT: Pt found to have increased edema in \nright upper extremity and an ultrasound was done which did show \nDVT. Pt was started on heparin gtt (lovenox not an option give \n___.  Repeat RUE US prior to discharge showed no clot. Given \nresolved clot, and low chance of clot in his baseline medical \ncondition (healthy ___ yom prior to rhabdo), and his new \nretroperitoneal bleed.  Heparin gtt was stopped before \ndischarge.\n\nRight flank pain\/RP hematoma: Patient had right flank pain that \nwas persistent after arrived on the floor.  Given his history of \ntrauma and recent anticoagulation due to his RU DVT, \nretroperitoneal bleed was considered. CT of abdomen was done to \neval for abnormalities and RP bleed was identified.  Serial HCT \nwas stable, VSS and HD stable.  He was discharged with follow up \ninstructions to his PCP. \n\nPolysubstance Use\/pain: patient admitted to actively using \ncocaine, and alcohol. SW consulted. Pt complained of severe \ndiffuse muscle pain, more than would be expected for \nrhabdomyolsis. Compartment syndrome was considered but pt's \nextremities remained warm and well perfused with good pulses. \nAlso, pt could not localize his pain to any one extremity. Pt \nwas felt to likely be withdrawing from opioids (pt does report \noccasional heroin use and ? other prescription medications). Pt \nwas initially treated c fentanyl boluses and then transitioned \nto PO morphine plus MSContin, which were then slowly weaned. Pt \ntreated with nephrocaps, thiamine, folate.  He was asymptomatic \nthroughout his stay on the floor and remained so at discharge. \n \nAnemia: Hct 33.2 on admit with MCV 89. At OSH, Hct 38. DIC, \nhemolysis, TTP were considered, however, other hemolysis and\/or \nDIC labs were negative. Pt's hematocrits were trended and an \nactive type and screen maintained.  He remained stable at \ndischarge.\n  \nAnion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: this was attributed to uremia in \nthe setting of acute onset renal failure. Ethanol and ASA \nscreens were negative. Resolved on the floor.\n\nHyponatremia: Given history of nausea and vomiting over 5 days, \nhyponatremia may be due to hypovolemia and GI losses.

Additionally, while you were in ICU, you had a deep vein clot in you right arm, however, after treatment and monitoring, the clot resolved. Your kidney and liver functions are returning to normal at discharge. We also found that you were hypertensive during your hospitalization. You will need to take the antihypertensive medication - Amlodipine after discharge."}

Dehydration was a significant \nfactor upon admission. Her hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic in \netiology, may also have been relevant to her overall sense of \nweakness. Though she was admitted with concern for possible \nParkinsons, she does not have any clear exam findings to suggest \nthis such as tremor or cogwheeling.

No N\/V\/SOB\/diaphoresis\/radiation. She was ruled out for MI \nwith serial unchanged ECGs, two sets negative CE. Her pain \nresolved with maalox and tylenol and did not return.\n\n.\n* Headaches\nAppears to be consistent with her chronic headache syndrome, \nthought to be cervical in etiology by neurology. History less \nsuggestive of other etiologies such as migraine, tension, or \neven temporal arteritis (but ESR was 3). Continued soft cervical \ncollar at night per neuro recs. Pain resolved with tylenol.\n\n.\n* Anemia\nSeen by ___ as an outpatient, felt to be related to CRI and \nsome degree of iron deficiency. Gets regular epo and iron \ninfusions.

On his \nmost recent cath in ___, he had a patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA \nand had 70% stenosis in SVG-OMB1 for which he underwent PTCA. He \nhas been having 6 months of progressive shortness of breath with \nexertion and two episodes of substernal chest pain with \nradiation into his right arm this week. He has a planned cath \nfor ___, though presented with an acute episode of chest \npain. He was started on high dose aspirin and continued on \nplavix, high dose statin, and heparin gtt. He initially had a \nnitro gtt due to ongoing pain and it was replaced with isordil \nTID for longterm control. He had no EKG changes or cardiac \nmarker increase. His INR trended to 1.8 and he underwent cardiac \ncath and a drug eluting stent was placed into his OM1 graft. \nAfter the stent placement, the patient remained chest pain free, \nthough had an elevation in his CK, CK-MB and index. The slope of \nhis cardiac markers was declining on discharge. He will continue \nASA 162 mg, Plavix, imdur, and high dose statin upon discharge. \n.\n# Atrial flutter with sick sinus syndrome, has pacer: The \npatient has a history of atrial flutter with sick sinus syndrome \nwith a pacer in place. On admission, the patient was in sinus \nrhythm. In the emergerncy room, he had asymptomatic bradycardia \nto ___. Electrophysiology saw the patient. His pacer was in \nAAI and not all of his atrial beats were being conducted to the \nventricle causing him to be bradycardic. His pacer settings were \nkept at AAI mode with switching to DDD mode if atrial beats are \nnot conducted. After EP reprogrammed his pacer, his HR ranged \nfrom 52-63. His pacer never malfunctioned. The patient was \ncontinued on his home sotalol. Warfarin was discontinued for his \ncardiac cath and restarted post-cath. \n.  \n# Pump: Similar to his last echo, the patient had a LVEF LVEF \n50-55% without any wall motion abnormalities. He had mild \nsymmetric LVH. On exam, euvolemic and no history of CHF.\n.\n# Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's calculated LDL in ___ \nwas 101 and he was recently increased to Atorvastatin 80 mg. His \nlipids should be monitored as an outpatient to ensure optimal \nmedical management of his CAD.\n.  \n# GERD: The patient has significant reflux-related symptoms and \nneeds pantoprazole to control his symptoms. It remains \ncontroversial whether or not PPIs have an interaction with \nPlavix, however, given the patient's severe GERD symptoms, he \nwould benefit from a PPI more than a H2 blocker.\n\nOutpatient followup:\n1. medical management of CAD: BP, cholesterol\n \nMedications on Admission:\nALBUTEROL SULFATE - 90 mcg HFA inhaler 2 puffs BID\nAMLODIPINE 5 mg daily\nATORVASTATIN [LIPITOR] - 80 mg daily \nBUDESONIDE-FORMOTEROL [SYMBICORT] - 160 mcg-4.5 mcg\/Actuation \nHFA Aerosol Inhaler - 2 puffs BID\nCLOPIDOGREL [PLAVIX] 75 mg daily \nFLUDROCORTISONE [FLORINEF] 0.05 mg daily \nISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE - 60 mg daily\nNITROSPRAY - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage uncertain  \nPANTOPRAZOLE [PROTONIX], delayed release 40 mg daily\nPOTASSIUM CHLORIDE - 20 mg daily\nSOTALOL - 40 mg daily\nTAMSULOSIN - 0.4 mg Capsule qHs  \nWARFARIN -  3mg daily \nASPIRIN - 81 mg daily\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

In addition, \nreported chills, new cough, DOE, found to have a leukocytosis \nand CXR findings of multifocal R.lobe PNA that is likely c\/w \ninfection but could be c\/w metastasis given history of \nmalignancy (although clinically pt with PNA). Pt was given IV \nlevofloxacin and IV flagyl to cover for community acquired \norganisms as well as anerobes. BCX, UCX, and sputum cultures \nwere sent. Sputum was contaminated x2. Pt was given guaifenesin \nand nebulizers for therapy. Pt was placed on aspiration \nprecautions. Pt was on room air upon admission and then quickly \nrequired 3.5-4L of oxygen. Pt remained on this requirement until \n___ when she required 1.5L. Her leukocytosis improved and her \ncough became very productive.  She will complete a course of PO \nantibiotics as an outpatient.  ___ WILL REQUIRE REPEAT EITHER CXR \nOR CT IMAGING AFTER TX COURSE FOR PNA TO EVALUATE FOR THE \nPOTENTIAL OF MALIGNANCY.\n.  \n#SOB\/hypoxia-pt reports SOB is chronic, but worsened recently. \nLikely due to PNA and recurrent aspiration as above. No CP or \nsuggestion of cardiac event. Pt presented on RA. Hypoxia \nworsened overnight after IVF. NO signs of clinical CHF. Suspect \nthat PNA has blossomed on imaging after hydration. Pt was ___. \nHypoxia improved with treatment of PNA. Upon discharge, oxygen \nrequirement 1.5L via nasal cannula.\n.  \n#hyperkalemia-unclear etiology.

Reports that GI has told her that she \nshould heal from PNA prior to re-dilation.  Pt was given IV \nfluids and allowed to eat what she felt she could tolerate. GI \nhas rescheduled her procedure to ___. If this pattern \ncontinues and pt does not have relief from dilatations, pt can \ndiscuss with her outpatient providers whether she would be a \ncandidate for and interested in tube feeds.  \n.  \n#h.o papillary and medullary thyroid cancer s\/p resection, \nradiation, on monthly octreotide. No known evidence of \nmetastasis. However, CXR raises concern given h\/o cancer of \nmetastasis. Pt will need repeat imaging after tx for PNA to \nevaluation for the possibility of metastasis. TSH was normal. \nContinued levothyroxine. \n.  \n#weakness\/poor po intake\/orthostatic hypotension-?fall. No \nsuggestion of syncopal event per pt history. Overall weakness is \nlikely due to poor po intake given stricture and poor appetite. \nPt reports that she drinks 3 cans of isosource daily, but does \nnot regularly drink fluids. This likely lead to orthostasis. Pt \nwas given IV fluids and treatment for PNA. Orthostasis resolved. \n___ consult was considered, but pt as able to ambulate the halls \nwithout difficulty.    \n.  \n#mild abdominal pain\/constipation-LFTs are normal. Pt reports \npain is due to constipation. However, she initially declined any \nbowel regimen. Resolved.  \n.  \n#social-Pt reports that overall she is \"tired of all this\".

The pain was initially felt to be most likely his \nCP is due to opioid withdrawal or musculoskeletal.  He had \nseveral preceding days of CP with negative cardiac enzymes so it \nwas unlikely to be ACS.  He was given several days of Aspirin \nwhile awaiting further evaluation.  His cholesterol levels were \nchecked but the sample was unfortunately not a fasting sample.  \nCXR was negative for a pulmonary source.  He was monitored for \n24 hours on telemetry with no events.  He was treated \nsymptomatically for suspected opioid withdrawal.  He had a \npharmacologic stress test because he could not exercise due to \nback pain, which did not show any ischemic changes on EKG or \nflow-limiting lesions on MIBI.  Anxiety likely plays a large \nrole in his chest pain because it would often be accompanied by \ncold sweats and resolved if he was able to calm himself.\n.\n# Back pain: The patient has long-standing chronic back pain and \nhad recently stopped taking oxycodone because he was concerned \nabout side effects.  He was given Neurontin, Flexeril and Ultram \nfor pain control, along with stool softeners to treat his \nconstipation.  He reported improvement in his pain.\n.  \n# Hypertension: He was very hypertensive on arrival and was \ninitially given an extra dose of 200mg of labetalol once while \nhis lisinopril was held because of renal failure.  He was \ndischarged on metoprolol and lisinopril. \n.\n# Urinary retention: the patient had painful retention over 10+ \nhours with bladder scan showing 500+ ccs.  Nursing and general \nmedical staff could not pass a foley, so urology was consulted.  \nA foley was passed and left in place for 48 hours.  He was given \n72hours of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.  A U\/A was negative for \ninfection.  He had not been taking his tamsulosin and \nfinasteride regularly, so these were restarted.  The foley was \nremoved and he was able to void.

She had \nan isolated ongoing ___ left-sided chest discomfort exacerbated \nby changes in position and with chest wall tenderness to light \npalpation. Despite prolonged chest pain, troponin-T and CK-MB \nnegative x2 and EKGs mostly unchanged from prior. Given known \nH\/O CAD, a vasodilator nuclear stress test was performed and was \nreassuring. Her discomfort did not change in intensity during \nthe stress test drug infusion. In the presence of diffuse ST-T \nwave changes, no additional ECG changes were noted during the \nprocedure. The hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion \nwas appropriate. Her perfusion study was normal with interval \nnormalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect. Given the \nstabbing quality and tenderness to palpation of the area of \ndiscomfort, her symptoms were most likely related to \ncostochondritis or other musculoskeletal causes.

Most likely reason for hypogylcemia was \ncontinuation of oral hypoglycemics (specifically glimiperide) \nand lantus while having decreased oral intake over the week \nprior to admission.  Her A1C of 5.6 indicates that she was most \nlikely having episodes of hypoglycemia over the last three \nmonths ___ being on four diabetes medications.  During admission \nwe initially held her oral hypogylcemics and placed pt on \nhumalog sliding scale.  Once her blood glucose levels were \nconsistently in the high 100's-low 200's, we restarted her \nlantus at a lower dose of 20 units qam.  We also initally \nre-started Actos, which was switched to metformin 500 mg bid \nbefore discharge once we identified her dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n#Anemia: Pt had a baseline Hct of 33.8 in ___, but was clearly \nanemic at the OSH (6.9\/23.6).  Per conversation with PCP, pt has \nh\/o iron defieciency and had been taking feosol 2 tabs daily.  \nShe also recieved B12 injections beginning in ___ for \naround ___ months but stopped since she did not feel that it \nreduced her fatigue.  Pt recieved 2 units of PRBC's with initial \nh&h rise to 8.8\/28.6.  Pt's normocytic anemia appeared to be \ncaused by mixed microcytic (iron defeiciency anemia- ferritin of \n9.4) and macrocytic (B12 of 107) causes.  Pt notes BRBPR over \nthe week prior to admisison, but does state that she has a h\/o \nhemorrhoids and that this is baseline for her.  It is likely \nthat the anemia was contributing to the pt's recent fatigue and \nweakness.  We started pt on cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM \ninjections, as well as restarting ferrous sulfate 325 mg tid for \niron deficiency.\n\n#Urinary tract infection:  U\/A was significant for ___ WBC and \nlarge amount of leukocyte esterase at OSH and culture was \npostive for greater than 100,000 CFU's of GBS.  Also had an \nelevated WBC of 13 on admisison.  It is posible that her UTI \nalso contributed to her fatigue and weakness at admission.  She \nwas given a dose of levoquin at OSH and started on amoxacillin \n500 mg q8h for seven days.\n\n#Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Pt had a positive troponin I of 0.54 \nat OSH and was actually transferred to ___ for further cardiac \nwork-up.  Once arriving here her troponins slowly trended upward \nfrom 0.06-->0.08-->0.09-->0.12.  Pt was completely asymptomatic \nother than one episode of nausea during the first night of \nadmission.  Her EKG was also fairly consistent with nonspecific \nT wave inversions.  We consulted cardiology who recommended \nobtaining an Echo, while stating that they did not beleive that \nthe presentation was consistent with ACS.  Echo on ___ showed \nsevere global LV systolic dysfunction with an EF of ___.  \nCardiology felt that this was most consistent with a \nnon-ischemic cardiomyopathy due to the global depression, but \nthat the pt would likely need a cardiac catherixation as an \noutpt to r\/o ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Her troponins stabalized \nat 0.18 on discharge.  Based on her new diagnosis of systolic \nCHF, she was started on aspirin 81 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 mg \nbid and valsartan 25 mg daily.\n\n#HTN:  Pt with a h\/o HTN, but not on any current medications and \nwas minimally hypertensive on this admission.  She was started \non metoprolol and valsartan for her dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n#HLD: Continued lipitor 10 mg daily.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n\n-Pt will need to establish a cardiologist for further work-up of \nher dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n-Pt will need to have B12 injections daily for the first week (4 \ndays remaining- ___ followed by \none injection a week for the next month and then monthly \nthereafter\n\n-Pt will need an outpt sleep study to be evaluated for likely \nOSA.\n\n-Pt will need an outpt colonoscopy to further investigate anemia \n(last colonoscopy was ___\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nGlucophage 500 mg bid\nGlimiperide 4 mg daily\nActos 45 mg daily\nProtonix 40 mg daily\nLipitor 10 mg daily\nLantus 35 units qpm \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

During your seizure, you fractured your left arm and that was repaired by orthopedics on ___. After the surgery you had agitation and tremulousness that was concerning for alcohol withdrawal. For severe symptoms we gave you ativan as needed, but you improved greatly by ___. Our physical therapists felt you were appropriate to be discharged to home with home ___ and a cane. There was no abnormality with your brain or infection to explain why you had a seizure. Given your tremulousness and agitation, we suspect that your seizure may be related to alcohol intake. It is very improtant that you make continued efforts to stop drinking, as withdrawal from alcohol will put you at risk for repeat seizures."}

s\/p C3 TIP ___ who p\/w RLE\/RUE weakness and a \nfall, found to have new brain lesion, concerning for metastatic \ndisease or second primary tumor.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Continue dexamethasone 4 mg BID until follow up with \nneuro-oncology. This was tapered from TID as of ___ \nevening. His insulin needs will fluctuate with this taper. His \ninsulin is being decreased by 30% to accommodate this change, \nbut will likely need further adjustment in insulin based on his \nsliding scale needs.\n[ ] Discharge diabetes regimen:\n- Continue Lantus 25 units QHS\n- Continue Humalog 12 units AC breakfast, Humalog 10 units AC\nlunch and Humalog 8 units AC supper\n- Continue sliding scale to start at 200 mg\/dL 2 units+2\nunits\/50mg\/dl\n- Metformin 1000 mg daily\n[ ] Continue PPI and Bactrim for prophylaxis while on steroids.\n[ ] Recommend slow dexamethasone taper when indicated given \nprolonged course. Would recommend transition to hydrocortisone \nto complete taper before stopping completely. \n[ ] Continue Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.\n[ ] Recommend rechecking electrolytes in 1 week to assess \nhyponatremia.\n[ ] Continue outpatient follow up with primary oncologist, neuro \noncologist and radiation oncology.\n\n#New left frontoparietal brain lesion\nHis R hemiplegia is most likely from the new brain lesion. MRI \ndemonstrated a 1 cm lesion with vasogenic edema. There is a \nquestion of whether this is a metastatic lesion vs new primary. \nTotal spine MRI without additional lesions. S\/p LP with CSF \nCytology, CEA, immunofixation and Beta2 macroglobulin negative. \nMore likely metastasis from penile Ca > new primary (e.g. GBM). \nWas seen by Neurosurgery, but patient denied surgery or biopsy. \nWith the caveat that a GBM would do poorly with radiation, \npatient elected to start Cyber Knife treatments to lesion. \nStarted Stereotactic XRT for brain lesion, and completed three \nfractions (___). Received dexamethasone before and \nduring radiation for reduction of vasogenic edema with good \nresponse and significant return of strength to RUE and RLE. His \ndexamethasone was tapered from 4 mg QID to TID, then to BID on \ndischarge. \n\n#T2DM\n#Increasing insulin requirements\nT2DM background, on home metformin, held as inpatient. Required \nlarge amounts of short acting insulin with metformin held and \nDexamethasone treatment. Had been started on Glargine nightly \nand\nhumolog with meals. The ___ has been \nconsulted and followed along, insulin scales adjusted as needed, \ninsulin teaching was provided prior to discharge. While on \ndexamethasone 4 mg TID he was stabilized on insulin regimen of \nglargine 35 U QHS, Humalog 17 U breakfast\/14 U lunch\/12 U dinner \nwith sliding scale. \nHis insulin was decreased by 30% on day of discharge given the \nplan to taper his dexamethasone. His metformin was held during \nthe admission and restarted on discharge.\n\n#Hypointensity in the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies\nDedicated C-spine MRI negative for spinal mets per Neuro Onc. \nT11 lesion identified by CT Torso and T-Spine MRI has been \nstable since ___ and unlikely represented new progression of \ndisease.\n\n#RUE, RLE weakness\nSecondary to new brain lesion as above. As per neuro oncology, \nless likely that RLE will recover. Radiation planned. ___ \nconsulted and are following, able to walk for short distances\ndaily. Will be discharged to ___ rehab.\n\n#UTI \/ Asymptomatic Bacteuria\nED UA reflexed to ___ and found to have bacteria in urine. Was \nstarted on Ceftriaxone for empiric care, final culture grew \nENTEROBACTER CLOACAE COMPLEX, and so therapy was escalated to IV \nCefepime and then changed to PO Bactrim. Assymptomatic and may \nbe colonized, however chose to complete a course of seven days.\n\n#Hyponatremia\nSodium trending low with nadir of 131 (baseline 141 on \nadmission). Clinically euvolemic. Normal blood osmolality, urine \nNa=65 and urine osmolality=441 raise concern for SIADH in the \npresence of known brain lesion, which was communicated to care \nteam. Hyponatremia asymptomatic. Stable at 131 with water \nrestriction, but seems dry by kidney function. Sodium up to 133 \nafter 500ml NS, but urine more concentrated (sodium 90, Osm \n~600). Sodium stable at 133 with further hydration and \nresolution of renal function to baseline, supporting \nhypovolemia. TSH wnl. Sodium stable after gentle hydration. \nElectrolytes were trended as needed.\n\n#Met Penile Squamous Cell Ca\nUnfortunately his high risk localized disease has rapidly \nprogressed to at least soft tissue and RP nodes. He is being \ntreated with TIP with palliative intent ___ ___ ___ \nw\/near CR. He completed TIP therapy ___ and has close f\/u \nwith oncology. Given negative LP and scans, planned for \nsurveillance as outpatient with follow up imaging at 8 weeks \nwith therapy reserved in case of progression of disease.\n\n#Asthma: quiescent\n- Continued advair\/flonase, albuterol prn\n\n#HTN: \n- Held ACEI and remained normotensive so was not continued on \ndischarge.

H1N1 Influenza: \nThe patient's symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, sore \nthroat, and nausea\/vomitting were consistent with influenza, and \nshe tested positive by DFA on nasopharyngeal swab.  She had been \nempirically started on Tamiflu 75mg twice daily in the ED due to \nher history of immunosuppression. The patient was initially \nhypoxic on admission, requiring supplemental oxygen which was \nmost likely attributable to her acute viral infection in the \nsetting of her restrictive lung disease associated with CREST. \nBy the second day of hospitalization, she was no longer \nrequiring oxygen.  On discharge, she was feeling comfortable and \nwas sent home with three additional days of oseltamivir, for a \ntotal of five days, and a droplet mask to be worn in public.  \nViral cultures after discharge confirmed that she was infected \nwith H1N1 flu.\n\nOf note, her daughter was admitted to ___ for \npositive influenza DFA swab as well. \n\n# Renal Transplant: \nThe patient's creatinine was initially 1.5 in the ED, elevated \nfrom a baseline of 1.0.  The patient had reported that she had \ndecreased oral intake of fluids due to her nausea and on exam \nshe had visibly dry mucous membranes.  She was given a bolus of \nIV fluids in the ED, and her creatinine normalized to 1.0 by the \nfollowing day. \n  \nAdditionally, the patient is known to have some chronic urinary \nretention, for which she has been told by her renal transplant \ndoctor to self straight cath as necessary at home because of \nincreased risk for recurrent urinary tract infections.  She did \nnot experience any problems with urinary retention during her \nbrief hospitalization.\n\nThe patient was followed closely by the renal transplant team \nduring her admission; her tacrolimus level was slightly elevated \nbut within acceptable range on the day of admission.  Her \ntacrolimus level on the day of discharge was pending at the time \nof discharge but will be followed by the primary team and the \nrenal transplant team. \n\n#. Diabetes, Type I: \nThroughout the admission, the patient's blood glucose levels \nwere elevated (200-400) and difficult to control.  Initially the \npatient tried to use her insulin pump to control her levels, \nhowever, it was discovered that her insulin pump cap has been \nbroken for some time.  Therefore, we discontinued the insulin \npump and started the patient on an insulin regimen of 60 units \nof lantus and 5 units of pre-prandial humalog in addition to a \nhumalog sliding scale.  Her blood glucose was stable in the 200s \nat discharge, and the patient was aware of how to perform the \ninsulin self injections according to the sliding scale at home.  \nShe was discharged on a similar insulin regimen with the basal \nglargine dose increased to 70 units at bedtime, and instructed \nto not use her insulin pump until it was repaired.  The patient \nstated that she has a glucometer with test strips at home but \nwas written for a prescription for both in case she were to need \nthem.

He presented to ___ with typical \nanginal symptoms resolved with nitroglycerin. He ruled out for \nmyocardial infarction however a stress revealed a grossly \nabnormal anterior wall. He was transferred to ___ for \nreconsideration of CABG or potential single vessel intervention. \nPlavix therapy was held and CT surgery was consulted. Due to the \npatient's advanced dementia and declining functional statues he \nwas again determined not to be a surgical candidate. An \nechocardiogram was performed on ___ and demonstrated an EF \nof >55%. A stress ECG was performed on ___ and showed: at 1 \nminute of recovery, 0.5-1 mm horizontal ST segment depression in \nthe inferior leads and V4-V6. During mid-recovery, a downsloping \nmorphology was noted in leads V4-V5. These changes resolved back \nto baseline by 7 minutes of recovery. Palliative cardiac \ncatheterization\/stenting was not recommended due to the diffuse \nnature of his disease. Metoprolol succinate XL 25mg and \nranolazine 500mg BID were started.

The gastroenterology specialists performed an upper endoscopy which showed a small pocket in your esophagus that could be causing your symptoms of feeling like food is getting stuck in your chest. Unfortunately there is no intervention for this. Try to keep a food diary and avoid the foods that cause these symptoms. They also noted small white areas in your esophagus which they took a sample of during the procedure. The gastroenterologists will call you with the results of this and determine if you need any treatment. We think your abdominal pain is related to your constipation, caused by your methadone use.

His course was complicated \nby post-procedural hypotension requiring pressors, IABP \nplacement, and CCU transfer.  He stabilized quickly, was \ntransferred back to the Cardiology floor, and was discharged to \nrehab.\n. \n#. CAD: s\/p BMS x3 and rotoablation to LAD.\nHe presented with worsening\/unstable angina despite medical \ntherapy with ranolazine (he has not tolerated nitrates in the \npast). On ___ had PCI that revealed heavily calcified LAD with \nostial 90% lesion and diffuse 70-80% stenoses in the mid and \ndistal vessel more severe than ___. Underwent rotoablation of \nLAD and 3BMS to ___ LAD. Procedure was complicated by low \nBPs to ___ and IABP placed with dopamine and levophed gtt. He \nwas transferred to the CCU where the IABP and pressors were able \nto be weaned off in <12 hours. He was able to be transferred \nback to the Cardiology floor where his blood pressures remained \nstable and he was slowly restarted on his home. He continues on \nlifelong  ASA daily and will need Clopidogrel for at least 1 \nmonth. He continues on a statin, beta blocker, ACEi, Ranolazine. \nHis ACEi was decreased from home dose as his BP only able to \ntolerate lower doses. He will follow up with Dr ___ in \nCardiology after discharge; he may benefit from a repeat TTE as \nan outpatient.  \n.\n#. Hypertension: Well controlled; he did have hypotension \npost-cath.\nSBP mostly ~110 but post-cath he did have the transient \nhypotension requiring pressors and IABP (see above).  Note that \nhis hypotension was likely due to ischemia from distal showering \nof plaque during cardiac cath (especially given that his cardiac \nenzymes increased afterwards). In the CCU his anti-hypertensives \nwere held but upon transfer to the Cardiology floor these were \nable to be added back.  His Lisinopril dose was changed to 20mg \ndaily. His Metoprolol was continued at his home dose. \n.\n#. Dementia: With delirium post-cath. Likely chronic vascular \ndementia.  At home he is alert but only oriented x1-2, \nintermittently confused, but after cardiac cath he was very \nagitated, confused, and combative requiring restraints and \nreorientation.  This resolved by the next morning. He continues \non home Seroquel, Memantine, and Galantamine.\n.\n#. Urinary retention: resolved. After cardiac catheterization he \nhad urinary retention requiring foley placement; this was likely \ndue to sedating medications he had received.  He passed a \nvoiding trial and was subsequently able to urinate without \ncomplication.\n.\n#. DM2: stable.\nIn house, he was covered with SSI Humalog.  He can continue his \noral hypoglycemics upon discharge.\n.\n#. Dyslipidemia: stable.\nLipid profile (___): TC-183, Trig-54, HDL-57, LDL \n115->68->88.  He was changed from Simvastatin to Atorvastatin \nand upon discharge will continue on Atorvastatin.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n.\n#. Latent TB: on treatment.\nCXR with pleural plaques.

She was \ntransitioned to oral lasix 40 mg BID.  Cardiology was consulted \na felt presentation was not complete consistent with ischemic \ncardiomyopathy and possibly reflective of a tachymyopathy.  She \nwill however need further imaging with a MIBI or possible \ncatheterization as an outpatient. She will also need a repeat \nTTE to evaluate valve and ventricular function now that she is \nno longer volume overloaded. She would likely also benefit from \ninitiation as an ACEi as an outpatient when renal function \nimproves. \n.\n___ creatinine was 1.8 on admission from a baseline \nof 1.2. This was felt to likely reflect poor cardiac forward \nflow leading to hypoperfusion. Patient was diuresed as above \nwith improvement in her creatinine to 1.6.

Patient was \nasymptomatic without chest pain or palpitations. TSH was within \nnormal limits.  In consultation with cardiology she was started \non metoprolol tartrate which was titrated upward to 150 mg twice \na day. This was converted to metoprolol succinate 150 mg BID. \nRates remained elevated to the ___ and she was started on \ndiltiazem with improved rate control.  The patient was only on \naspirin on admission.  However she was initiated on warfarin at \nthe time of discharge. The decision was made not to undertake \nbridging therapy. Patient will ___ in the ___ \n___ clinic for INR monitoring and warfarin dose \nadjustment.  \n.  \n#Kidney Transplant- Patient was continued on her home \nimmunosuppresives, including Cyclosporine, Cell Cept and \nsteroids. His BK virus PCR was negative.  Cyclosporine levels \nwere appropriate.   \n.  \n#Thrombocytopenia- Patient's platelets were noted to decrease \nfrom admission platelet count of 140's to the 80's with recovery \nto the 100s. In the differential is HIT and splenic \nsequestration. Heme onc consult has recommended HIT ab and \nvarious viral PCR's. The HIT antibody was negative. CMV viral \nload was negative. Parvovirus titers were negative and EBV \ntiters were pending at the time of discharge.  Reticulocyte \ncount was appropriate. Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels were \nwithin normal limits. Infectious ___ including blood and \nurine cultures were negative. There was no evidence of bleeding. \nThe patient will need close monitoring of her platelet count as \nan outpatient. Patient will also need a US to rule out \nsplenomegaly.  \n.\n#DM- Patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale. Oral \nhypoglycemics were restarted on discharge.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Patient will ___ with transplant nephrology, cardiology \nand with a new ___ PCP\n- ___ INR monitoring and dose adjustment was transitioned \nto ___ clinic\n- EBV titers were pending at the time of discharge\n- Patient will need an US to evaluate for splenomegaly, repeat \nTTE and stress MIBI \n- Patient will need to have her creatinine and platelet count \nmonitoring\n- Patient was full code throughout this admission\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg TID \nGlipizide 5mg Qd \nPrednisione 5mg Qdaily \nLorazepam 0.25mg Q12 H PRN agitation \nCyclosporine 50mg BID \nMycophenolate Mofetil 500mg BID \nCiprofloxacin 500mg BID \nFlagyl 500mg TID \nMVI \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n2. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 \nhours) as needed for insomnia\/anxiety .\nDisp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. metoprolol succinate 50 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig: \nThree (3) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO BID (2 times a day).\nDisp:*180 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO \nBID (2 times a day).  \n5. multivitamin     Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day.  \n\n6.

An evaluation was undertaken for \npossible structural, toxic, metabolic, and infectious \netiologies.  Non-contrast CT of the head showed no acute change; \n only those associated with prior hemorrhage.  Laboratory \nevaluation was unremarkable.  EEG showed infrequent, isolated \nleft anterior temporal spike and wave discharges and persistent \nleft frontotemporal slowing consistent with history of her \nhemorrhage.\n\nOnce patient's mental status cleared, it was possible to ellicit \na history that she has not been able to take her home keppra due \nto inability to open medication containters.  Her medication is \nusually administered by a friend whom she lives with.

He was admitted with volume overload from heart \nfailure exacerbation and pneumonia with high oxygen \nrequirements. He initially required CCU admission for high flow \noxygen, weaned to nasal cannula after aggressive IV diuresis and \ntreatment of pneumonia with 5 day course of Zosyn after \nreceiving vancomycin at OSH. He was transferred to cardiology \nfloor where he continued to diurese well and his oxygen \nrequirement was weaned to ___. He was transitioned to 60 mg \ntorsemide PO BID which adequately maintained euvolemia. \n\nACUTE ISSUES: \n============= \n# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation\nPatient with history of heart failure with etiology likely \nischemic cardiomyopathy given history of CAD s\/p CABG and PCI. \nAdmitted with fluid overload and pleural effusion. Trigger for \ncurrent exacerbation could be infectious given evidence of \npneumonia in left lower lobe on admission. Patient with high \noxygen requirements prior to admission but responded \nappropriately to diuresis with Lasix. After IV diuresis, patient \nwas transitioned PO torsemide and maintained at euvolemia. With \neffective diuresis, the patient's oxygen requirement gradually \nlowered from 4L NC to ___ NC. He was discharged on torsemide 60 \nmg PO BID. He was unable to tolerate afterload reducing agents \nor neurohormonal blockade agents due to hypotension. \n\n# Lower left lobe pneumonia\nPatient with evidence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, \nreceived vanc\/zosyn at outside hospital and continued on Zosyn \nhere for a total of 5 day course with resolution of symptoms. We \nsuspect that his lingering O2 requirement is at least in part \ndue to slowly resorbing consolidation left over from his \ninfection. He was requiring ___ of supplemental O2 by NC at \ntime of discharge.\n\n# Pleural effusion, bilateral\nPatient with evidence of right pleural effusion. Etiology likely \nfluid overload given heart failure with reduced ejection \nfraction. Pleural effusion resolved improved with diuresis and \nhis oxygen requirement trended down to ___ NC. Given this, \nthoracentesis was deferred. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation\nPatient with chronic history of atrial fibrillation. In afib \nthroughout this admission. Continued amiodarone and apixaban. \nRates appropriately controlled.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n================\n# Coronary artery disease s\/p CABG\nPatient with history of 3 vessel CABG on ___ (___) and\nsubsequent PCI to LAD (___). Continued home aspirin. Patient \nwas started on low dose rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. On review, it \nappears he had been on this medication at this dose in the past \nbut it was discontinued due to transamnitis; however, at the \ntime it was unclear whether this was an effect of the statin or \npembrolizumab. Given that the patient has not had his checkpoint \ninhibitor therapy since ___, the decision was to restart \nrosuvastatin. \n\n# Chronic kidney disease\nBaseline Cr appears to be 2.1-2.2 over past year.

MRSA Bacteremia:  Pt had recurrent MRSA bacteremia in the \nsettting of vancomycin treatment.  We are particularly concerned \nabout endocarditis from ICD given the refractory nature.  \nHowever, removal of instrumentation is not an option per patietn \nand family wishes.  Source of infection include sacral \ndecubitous ulcer, UTI, ventilation.  Pt does not have \nleukocytosis or fever.  Chronic colonization likely.  Complete \nbacterial clearance is unlikely in this setting.  \nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- START Daptomycin indefinitely\n- PICC line in place, routine care\n.\n#. GIB: Pt presented with HCT drop and Bright red blood through \nostomy.  He received a total of 3 units pRBC blood transfusion. \nWe temporarily stopped tube feeding the setting of GIB, and \ndiscontinued his aspirin.  His HCT has been stable in the past \n48 hours without transfusion.  GI has been consulted, and did \nnot feel that the benefit of osteostomy-scope outweighs its \nrisk.\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- CONTINUE tube feeding as scheduled\n- STOP aspirin and anti-platelets forever. \n- START pantoprazole 40 mg iv bid\n- CONTINUE ferrous sulfate, sucrafate\n.\n#. ___: Pt presented with elevated Cr to 3.5 on admission with \nanuria.  There was muddy brown cast on urine sedimentation, \nconcerning for ATN in the setting of sepsis and tobramycin \nexposure.  We gave him gentle fluid challenge, and his urine \noutput recovered shortly afterwards.  His creatinine decreased \nto 2.7 on the day of discharge.  This may or may not ever go \nback down to his previous baseline.  Regardless, he's not anuric \nand patient and family have refused initiation of dialysis.\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- AVOID nephrotoxic medication\n- DISCONTINUE Lisinopril\n.\n#. Hematuria and UTI:  Pt has indwelling foley catheter and \npresented with hematuria and positive UA.  Urine culture was \nnotable for VRE, fungus.  We treated him with meropenem and \nfluconazole while he was in the MICU.  He received bladder \nirrigation for hematuria.  His hematuria resolved on the day of \ndischarge.  Pt was asymptomatic from his UTI.  We felt it is \nimpossible to completely treat his UTI.  We decided to \nwithdrawal treatment for now to minimize the hepatic and renal \ndrug intoxication.\n.\n#. Decubitus ulcer: Pt has a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer over sacrum \nand left thigh.  The pain from decubitous ulcer is his major \nconcern while he was here.  He was seen by wound care.  They \nadvise supportive care.\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- Pleae CHANGE BODY POSITION every 2 hours\n- Please provide adequate pain management with lidocaine patch, \nfentanyl, oxycodone.\n.\n#. Positive sputum culture: Pt has trach tube.  His sputum \nculture grew multiresistant klebsiella and pseudomonas.  Pt \nremained afebrile, no leukocytosis, left shift or increased \nsputum production.  We felt the complete irradiation was unlikey \ngiven his current clinical status and suspect he has permanent \ncolonization.\n.  \nCHRONIC ISSUES\n#. Chronic dCHF: Pt has diastolic CHF.  We continued his \nbeta-blocker for the need of rate control.  We held his \nlisinopril in an hope of protecting his current kidney function. \n We held his aspirin in the setting of GI bleeding.  We felt \nthat active treatment for his CHF is less of a priority.\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- DISCONTINUED Aspirin and all antiplatelet drugs\n- DISCONTINUED Lisinopril\n.\n#. Atrial fibrillation: Pt is AV paced on telemetry. Not on \nanticoagulation given history of GI bleeding.  Rate controlled \nwith carvedilol.\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES\n- Per our EP recommendation, they can disable the defibrillator \nfunction, while still keep AV pacing, if there is a need in the \nchange of goal of care.  \n.\n# Depression: Continue citalopram.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\nPt declared a code status of DNR\/DNI.  Extensive discussion has \noccurred between family and care provider team on goal of care.  \nIn general, our understanding is that family would like \ncontinued conservative treatment, with no invasive procedure, \nincluding the use of pressors.  We have conveyed clearly to the \nfamily that clinical improvement is unlikely in the current \nsituation.  Pt's family expressed concerns that patient has not \nbeen getting enough comfort care (ie skin, wound, pain).\n.\nThe wife has expressed continued frustration with being \ntransferred back and forth from rehab to the hospital.  We \nassured her that the care provided to him at rehab is very good. \n In general, we'd try to limit the number of unecessary \nhospitalizations.  We explained to the family, with the son \npresent in the room, that the patient's condition is stable, but \nultimately is declining.  We explicity told them that things are \nprobably as good as they'll ever be, and that in the future he \nwill have a slow and steady decline.  We are limited in \ninterventions that can be done here in hospital and have \nconveyed that to his family.   \n.\n.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAcetylcysteine 100mg TID intratracheal\nCarvedilol 6.25mg BID\nCitalopram 20mg daily\nDocusate sodium 100mg BID\nFerrous sulfate elixir 325mg daily\nFolic acid 1mg daily\nLidocaine patch daily\nMVI daily\nOmeprazole 20mg daily\nSimethicone 80mg BID\nSucralfate 1gm TID\nFentanyl 12mcg patch Q72hrs\nAcetaminophen 650mg Q6H prn pain\nAlbuterol inhaler 2 puffs Q4H prn SOB\nPsyllium 1 teaspoon TID\nOxycodone 5mg Q4H prn pain \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nOxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  ___ mg PO\/NG Q4H:PRN pain hold \nfor sedation or RR <12  \nCitrate ___ mcg IV Q4H:PRN dressing changes \nAlbuterol Inhaler 6 PUFF IH Q4H:PRN shortness of breath, \nwheezing \nPantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H\nDaptomycin 540 mg IV Q48H \nAcetaminophen (Liquid) 650 mg PO\/NG Q6H:PRN pain  \nFentanyl Patch 12 mcg\/hr TP Q72H last changed ___ @ 12:45\nSucralfate 1 gm PO\/NG TID\nSimethicone 80 mg PO\/NG TID\nMultivitamins 1 TAB PO\/NG DAILY\nLidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY\nFoLIC Acid 1 mg PO\/NG DAILY\nFerrous Sulfate (Liquid) 300 mg PO\/NG DAILY\nDocusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg PO\/NG BID\nCitalopram 20 mg PO\/NG DAILY  \nCarvedilol 6.25 mg PO\/NG BID\nMVI daily\nPsyllium 1 teaspoon TID\nAcetylcysteine 100mg TID intratracheal\n\nPt was administered the flu vaccine ___\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nMRSA bacteremia with likely pacemaker colonization, multiple \ndecubitus ulcers, ventilator dependence, acute kidney injury, \ngastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infection, chronic \ncongestive heart failure.\n \nDischarge Condition:\nfair","summary":"As you know, the blood stream infection is probably chronic and it would basically be impossible to cure of you that.

Hopsital course was complicated by \nworsening hypoxemia to 6L O2 requirement despite adequate \ndiuresis with net negative 12.8L length of stay. Her O2 was \neventually able to be weaned to 3L, thought to primarily be \nattributed to her severe splenomegaly. For her MPD\/MDS, she was \nre-started on jakafi and hydroxyurea was up-titrated to 500mg \nBID. She required frequent PRBC with lasix and platelet \ntransfusions. Was also treated for 2 UTIs, first a pan-sensitive \nklebsiella UTI and second zosyn-sensitive UTI, ultimately \ndischarged on cipro per AST recommendations. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n===============\n#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure\n#Volume Overload - With history of MDS\/MPD and COPD presenting \nwith hypoxemic respiratory failure initially requiring 4L O2. \nAdmission CXR showing mild pulmonary edema. Hypoxemia was \nthought to be secondary to acute on chronic HFpEF in the setting \nof frequent transfusions required in the outpatient setting for \nher MDS\/MPD. Was diuresed with intermittent lasix 40 IV boluses \nand was net negative 12.8L length of stay. Hospitalization was \ncomplicated by worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure to 6L, \nhowever was subsequently able to be weaned to 3L O2 prior to \ndischarge. TTE showed some mild symetric LVH with normal cavity \nsize and regional\/global biventricular systolic function. It was \nnoted she had a calcific AV with mild AR and moderate TR with \nmoderate pHTN. Her 3L O2 requirement in large part was \nattributed to her severe splenomegaly and poor diaphragmatic \nmovement. She was ultimately discharged on 3L O2 home with \nmaximal services. \n\n#MDS\/MPD\n#Leukocytosis\n#Thrombocytopenia\n#Anemia - History of MPD\/MDS overlap syndrome with massive \nsplenomegaly requiring frequent transfusions and with splenic \ninfarcts, previously on dacogen and hydrea recently re-started \non vidaza followed by Dr. ___. During hospitalization was \nstarted on ___. Unfortunately WBC up-trended to peak 182,000. \nGiven her allergy to allopurinol, patient was started on \nhydroxyurea. Prior to discharge hydroxyurea was titrated to \n500mg BID. While on 1G BID, her WBC down-trended however was \ncomplicated by worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia. Prior to \ndischarge her hydrea was titrated from 500QD to 500 BID with WBC \non discharge 57.6. As per extensive goals of care conversations, \npatient wishing to continue with transfusions at this time. \nRequired frequent PRBC and platelet transfusions, of note with \ndifficult cross match to PRBC given numerous antibodies to \nPRBCs. Discharge Hb 7.2 and PLT 12, received an additional unit \nof PRBC and PLT given follow-up arranged on ___ for next CBC \ncheck.\n\n#Abdominal pain - Presented with worsening LUQ abdominal pain \nthought to be secondary to known severe splenomegaly. Abdominal \nUS showed corase hepatic parenchyma suggesting fibrosis with \nmarked splenomegaly 27.9 cm. Abdominal pain subsequently \nimproved on oxycontin 10mg PO bid and oxycodone 5mg PO Q4H:PRN.\n\n___ - Presented with ___ with Cr 1.3 on admission. Was thought \nto be secondary to hyperuricemia with uric acid 10.9 on \nadmission. Received 2 doses of rasburicase however uric acid did \nnot trend downwards. ___ have had possible pre-renal component \ngiven relatively poor PO intake, Cr down-trended to normal with \nblood product administration. Cr on discharge 1.3. Likely \nslightly volume contracted in the setting of aggressive \ndiuresis, however taking into consideration risk\/benefit ratio \nof keeping slightly volume down as she will require frequent \nblood product administration with her hypoxemic respiratory \nfailure. \n\n#Hyperuricemia - With elevated uric acid 10.9 on admission, \nreceived 2 doses of rasburicase, however uric acid did not trend \ndown-wards and did not meet guidelines for ___ additional dose \ngiven Cr did not rise >1.8. Was initially hypokalemic and \nwithout hypocalcemia not supporting TLS. Her phosphate trended \nup-wards to 9.2 for which she was started on sevelamir, however \nclinical picture was not entirely consistent with TLS. \n\n# Recurring UTI - Found to have symptomatic pan-sensitive \nklebsiella UTI on ___ for which she was treated with CTX x 5 \ndays. On ___, still was complaining of persistent urinary \nsymptoms that was largely resistant, sensitive to zosyn and \nintermediate to cipro. In discussion with AST, decision was made \nto treat with zosyn inpatient and was determined acceptable to \ntreat with cipro for 7 day course total through ___. Given \nintermediate sensitivity, patient will require close follow-up \nin outpatient setting to continue to monitor for urinary \nsymptoms and\/or fever. \n\n#Goals of care - After extensive goals of care conversations \nwith patient and primary oncologists Dr. ___ elected \nto continue with cancer directed treatment. She also still \nexpressed that ongoing transfusions are within her goals of \ncare. With poor prognosis given her worsening hypoxemic \nrespiratory failure. Arrangements were made for a discharge home \nwith plan for patient to follow-up with primary oncologists \napproximately 3 times per week for ongoing transfusions. Patient \nwas instructed to return to the Emergency Department if \nworsening shortness of breath or hypoxemia.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n=================\n#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Home metformin 850mg PO QD was \ninitially held during admission, placed on ISS while inpatient. \n\n#Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 88mcg PO QD\n\n#Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin initially held due to concern for \nhemolysis, was resumed on discharge. \n\n#Depression: Continued home Lexapro\n\n#GERD - Cont home Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=====================\n[ ] NEW\/CHANGED MEDICATIONS \n- Started ruxolitinib 5 mg oral DAILY \n- OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg PO Q4H:PRN Pain - Moderate \nfor abdominal pain\n- OxyCODONE SR (OxyconTIN) 10 mg PO Q12H for abdominal pain\n- Started sevelamir 800mg PO TID with meals\n- Started cipro 500mg PO BID for ___ntibiotics \nto continue through ___\n\n[ ] Discharged on 3L O2\n[ ] Follow-up arranged with Dr. ___ on ___ will need \nrepeat labs and likely transfusions with discharge Hb 7.2 and \ndischarge PLT 12\n[ ] Outpatient titration of hydrea as indicated discharge WBC \n57.6\n[ ] Discharge Cr 1.3.

At ___, you were found to have blockages in your heart; it did not seem like these were new or causing a new heart attack, but they may have been there for a while and contributed to your shortness of breath. You were found to have new heart failure, which means the heart is not pumping as well as it should be. This is what caused your body to accumulate fluid. You were given IV diuretics. You were transferred to ___ to be evaluated by our Heart Failure team. We did a lot of tests, including an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), a heart MRI, and a stress test. We did all of this to find out what caused your heart failure. These tests showed that it is probably blockages in the arteries (atherosclerosis\/plaques or heart attacks) that caused your heart failure. The MRI that we did showed that there may be possibly another reason (such as inflammation from a virus in the past) that also may have contributed to your heart failure."}

There is normal \nleft ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There \nis suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular \nfunction. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection \nfraction is 70%. Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 \nL\/min\/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract \ngradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler \nsuggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP \ngreater than 18mmHg).

Normal pulmonary \npressure. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ year old female with a history of hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, ovarian cancer s\/p \nchemo and surgical interventions, who presents with word finding \ndifficulties and recent falls.\n\n#Subacute left globus pallidus infarct: Initial Non-contrast \nheadache CT was negative for acute hemorrhage, and alteplase was \nnot administered due to extended duration of symptoms and \nthrombectomy was not done d\/t no large vessel occlusion. MRI \nhead w\/ contrast revealed a possible subacute infarct in left \nbasal ganglia. Exam was notable for very subtle apraxia, \nneglect, and migrographia which the patient said was new. She \nhad mild hesitancy in her speech but no aphasia. Clinically, the \npatient appeared to be improving, however had two episodes on \n___, in which the patient experienced nausea and bradycardia \n(heart rate in ___, and was briefly unresponsive for a few \nseconds. The first of these episodes began while the patient was \nwalking with ___, with bradycardia and unresponsiveness occurring \nafter the patient lay down. She regained conscious within a few \nseconds. The second episode occurred while the patient was \nsitting in bed and included a 5.5 second pause on telemetry with \nloss of consciousness, left eye deviation, left head turning and \nbilateral upper extremity shaking. She regained consciousness in \n~30 seconds and was noted to have new right facial droop, right \nupper extremity weakness, and fluent aphasia with word salad. \nNIHSS at this time was 10. Imaging at that time, including \nnon-contrast head CT and CTA were unremarkable, and following \nCT, NIHSS improved to 5. Alteplase was not administered due \nfluctuating exam and rapid improvement. Exam continued to \nimprove with only mild aphasia. EEG was done that showed mild \nleft sided slowing but no discharges or electrographic seizures. \nLikely episode of eye deviation, head deviation, and upper \nextremity shaking iso bradycarida and sinus pause was convulsive \nsyncope. MRI head without contrast later revealed stable \nsubacute infarct in the left globus pallidus without any new \nareas of infarct or hemorrhage. Stroke risk factors include TSH \n0.4, fasting lipid panel LDL 123, and HBA1c 7.7. She was started \non aspirin 81mg and her simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin \n40mg. Likely etiology of stokes is small vessel\/lacunar. \n\n#Cognitive Decline: Felt that likely some of her symptoms were \ndue to overlying dementia that may have been worsening as \npatient lives alone and per family recently stopped taking her \nmedications. B12 and RPR were checked and were normal. Unclear \nhow well she has been functioning at home prior to this as she \nlives alone. She also has had repeated falls at home which she \nis unable to describe or explain. \n\n#HTN: Her hypertensive medications were held other than HCTZ to \nallow blood pressure to auto-regulate. She was noted to be \nintermittently hypertensive and her home medications were \nre-started. There were held again after syncope described above. \nPrior to discharge she was restarted on amlodipine but losartan \nand HCTZ were held. \n\n#Syncope: During hospitalization, as described above, she had \nhad a series of episodes of bradycardia. During the first \nepisode, she became unresponsive and was noted to be bradycardic \nto as low as the ___ on telemetry with a 3 second pause, \nfollowed by subsequent hypertension and tachycardia up to the \n110 bpm range. About 10 minutes later, she had a similar \nepisode. Finally, after she had been stabilized in bed, a third \nepisode of bradycardia occurred with a documented 5.5 second \npause and associated period of unresponsiveness. After she \nrecovered, she had worsened aphasia, as well as weakness and \nfacial droop, as described above. Telemetry was considered to be \nconsistent with vagal etiology, without nodal block. She has no \nprior history of arrhythmias or conduction disease. \nTransthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed normal \nBiventricular systolic function, no cardiac source of embolus. \nEP Cardiology was consulted and felt that these episodes were \nconsistent with vasovagal and did not warrant any further \ninvestigation or intervention. We discussed worry that this \nepisode may have caused some increased hypoperfusion and \nre-infarction iso new facial droop, weakness, and aphasia after \nsyncope. EP felt that since likely vasovagual there was no \nindication for pacemaker as this would not prevent the \nvasodilation associated with vasovagual and would not prevent \nhypoperfusion. They felt that if highly symptomatic episodes \ncontinue even with vagal triggers minimized. In the future all \nnodal blockade should be avoided. She has been scheduled for \ncardiology follow up. She was discharged with ___ of hearts \nmonitor. \n\n#Diabetes: Glucose was monitored throughout stay and insulin \nadministered on sliding scale. HbgA1C 7.7. Per daughter she has \nnot been taking her medications for at least a the past week or \nso. She was restarted on home metformin at discharge. She has an \nendocrinology appointment scheduled for this month. \n\n==================== \nTransitional Issues \n[] Patient has neurology appointment scheduled in ___ with \nDr. ___. She can be referred to cognitive neurology at that \ntime if she has decline in cognition \n[] Patient should have Holter monitor to assess for continued \nvagal syncope. Has cardiology outpatient follow up \n[] Please avoid all nodal blockade in the future \n[] Holding losartan and HCTZ due to lightheadedness on standing, \nPCP to check BP in outpatient setting and manage medications \n\n==========================\nAHA\/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic \nAttack 1.

Labs notable for \ntransaminitis and microscopic hematuria. Seen by dermatology and \nrheumatology and underwent skin biopsy with pathology confirming \nleukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). The recent history of \nAugmentin usage and infection is consistent with LCV. Her \nAugmentin was held and she was started on prednisone to which \nshe improved. At the time of discharge, she was having resolving \ntransaminitis, resolved microscopic hematuria, and improved \nankle right pain and lower right leg swelling, although still \nnoticing new petechiae, which can be seen in LCV despite \nwithdrawal of offending stimulus. Continued on prednisone 20mg \ndaily on discharge with a plan to decrease to 15mg daily after \none week and follow up with rheumatology and dermatology. \n\n#Right submandibular gland swelling: \nPatient initially presented to an outside urgent care clinic on \n___ with right submandibular gland swelling and tenderness, \nstarted empirically on Augmentin, and initially thought to have \nsialolithiasis with concurrent infection, which is plausible \ngiven that patient's symptoms improved with Augmentin therapy. \nHowever, given the family history of ___ and the patient's \njoint symptoms on her admission to ___, there was concern that \nher initial jaw tenderness could have been part of a broader \nrheumatological process and a rheumatological workup was done. \nAt the time of discharge, her workup was notable for negative \n___, negative ANCA, and negative Sjogren antibodies, and the \npatient's right submandibular gland swelling and tenderness had \nimproved significantly and she was otherwise stable. She will \nneed to follow up with ENT after discharge, and consider \npossible CT scan.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n==============\n#Retinal tear: Continued home eye drops\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==================\n1.) Patient should have sutures removed on ___ from her biopsy \nsite. \n2.) If pruritus develops, dermatology recommended triamcinolone \n0.1% ointment BID to affected areas - use up to two weeks per \nmonth.\n3.) Patient's malignancy screening should be clarified to ensure \nthat she is up to date\n4.) Pt needs to follow up with ENT for management of the right \nsubmandibular gland swelling. Consider outpatient CT neck per \nENT.\n5.) Pt needs to continue prednisone 20mg daily and then decrease \nto 15mg daily after one week until follow up with outpatient \nrheumatology.\n6.) Augmentin added to the allergy list. It is unclear whether \npatient can be exposed to penicillins in the future; can \nconsider outpatient allergy referral \n7.)

Most likely in the setting of B-blocker and CCB \nbeing held due to hypotension. C. diff infection (see below) \nmost likely contributing to hypotension. Pt received IV \nmetoprolol and IV diltiazem in ED and was started on PO \nmetoprolol\/diltiazem on floor. She was also fluid resuscitated. \nPatient discharged with control of afib with RVR with PO metop \nand diltiazem at home doses. INR was supratherapeutic and \ncoumadin was held (see below). \n\n# Hypotension: Per nursing home, she had intermittent \nhypotension requiring  discontinuation of her metoprolol and \ndiltiazem. Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake\/loose \nstools from C.diff infection. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to \nchronic steroid use in the setting of infection was ruled out \nwith AM cortisol (30). \n\n# Funguria, bacteruria: Pt initially reported dysuria and UA x2 \nshowed large leuks\/bacteria\/yeast. Despite being contaminated, \ndue to symptoms of dysuria, she was initially treated with IV \nCTX. Urine cultures eventually grew only yeast, prompting \ndiscontinuation of CTX. She was no longer symptomatic at this \ntime, and she had no CVA tenderness or systemic symptoms of \ninfection. She had a foley place initially for urine output \nmonitoring, however, this was removed. Funguria will be treated \nwith fluconazole for total 7 days of therapy. \n\n# C.difficile infection: Although no recent history of \nantibiotics, patient immunosuppressed and at rehabilitation \nfacility. She was initially started on PO metronidazole on \n___, but this was changed to PO vanc, given that she is \nimmunosuppresed and falls into the severe category. ___, \n___.\n\n# Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 6.5. Most likely secondary \nto decreased PO ntake and exacerbated antibiotics. No active \nsigns of bleeding. Once INR reached 7.8, she was given 2.5 mg PO \nvitamin K. She received additional 2.5 mg PO vitamin K on \n___. Coumadin was held on discharge.  \n\n# Acute on chronic CKD (stage 3): Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8-1.1). \nMost likely secondary to decreased PO intake and decreased \ncardiac output from afib with RVR. Creatinine improved with IVF.\n\n# Lower extremity edema: Multi-factorial. Most likely venous \nstasis vs diastolic heart failure, especially in the setting of \nafib with RVR, vs hypoalbuminemia. Pa\/lateral film in ED showed \nno cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascualar congestion to suggest \ndecompensated systolic heart failure. Pt on furosemide at home. \nAlbumin was 3.0. Furosemide held on admission due to ___. Edema \nwas managed with pneumatic boots. Furosemide was restarted at 40 \nmg on discharge. \n\n# UPJ obstruction s\/p stent placement ___ c\/b persistent \nKlebsiella bacteruria: Pt scheduled for stent replacement soon. \nShe had no CVA tenderness on exam and creatinine was stable \nafter IVF.

Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not \nimmediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted \nand received fluid boluses.  He was also started on BID PPI \ntherapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and \nwarfarin) were held.  His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, \nbut as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his \nostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution \nthan continued brisk bleeding.  Still, at that time transfusion \nwas offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he \ncontinued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic \ntransfusion was held.  As the day progressed hematocrit rose \nback to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his \nhospitalization.  Gastroenterology was consulted on the day \nafter presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after \nallowing the INR to fall for a day.  Unfortunately, the INR \nremained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to \nproceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless \ntheir was overt, active bleeding.  On EGD the patient had \ngastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources \nof bleeding.  ___, no intervention was performed and the patient \nwas discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant \nregimen to follow up in GI clinic.  Stools at discharge were \nnon-melenic.  Hematocrit was greater than 25.    \n\n2) CAD s\/p BMS ___: The patient has history of coronary artery \ndisease and had bare metal stents placed in ___.  \nNevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active \nischemia.  His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation \ndue to concern for active bleeding.  At discharge he was \nrestarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one \nyear out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold \nclopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of \nanticoagulants the patient was taking.  The patient's \ncardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and \nthought it was reasonable.  \n\n3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by \nprevious echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume \noverload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital.  Initially, his \naspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in \nthe context of potentially active bleeding and concern about \nhemodynamic stability.  These were all restarted prior to \ndischarge.  \n\n4)HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension but was never \nfrankly hypertensive in the hospital.  His anti-hypertensives \nwere initially held in the hospital and then restarted as \ndescribed in the previous problem point.  \n\n5)Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient is on metoprolol for \nrate control and warfarin for stroke prevention.  His rate \nremained relatively well controlled even when metoprolol was \nbeing held. His warfarin was held on presentation but restarted \nafter his procedure.  His INR never became subtherapeutic.  He \nwill follow up with his PCP for further INR monitoring. \n\nAs the patient was systemically anticoagulated no further DVT \nprophylaxis was given.  He was on BID PPI for GI bleed.  He \ntolerated a full diet prior to discharge.  He was full code. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nClopidogrel 75 daily  \nAspirin 325 daily  \nWarfarin (goal INR ___  \nFurosemide 40 daily  \nLisinopril 5 daily  \nMetoprolol succinate 25 daily  \nAmitryptiline  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

F with history of rheumatic fever and mechanical mitral \nvalve who presented with fevers, chest pain, and shortness of \nbreath, found to have MSSA Bacteremia and endocarditis.\n\n# MSSA Bacteremia \/ Endocarditis:  This was initially a presumed \ndiagnosis based on her history of oral lesion with fevers and a \nprosthetic mitral valve.  She received vancomycin and pip\/tazo \nin the ED.  Eventually blood cultures grew back MSSA, and \ncoverage was changed to gentamicin (2 weeks, lst day ___, \nrifampin (6 weeks, last day ___, and nafcillin(6 weeks, \nlast day ___. TEE was performed which revealed a small \nvegetation, and Cardiac Surgery was consulted and did not think \nshe was a surgical candidate at this time.  During her course of \nantibiotics, her rifampin was held due to elevated total \nbilirubin, a known side effect; however, this normalized and \nrestarted per ID.  Daily EKG's were checked which never revealed \nconcerning signs of abscess.  Daily screening BCx x2 were never \npositive after the initial set.  The patient is scheduled for an \noutpatient transesophageal echocardiogram in ___ at \n9 AM per her outpatient cardiologist.\n.  \n# Poor dentition and possible dental abscesses: Ms ___ had a \nmandible series and a panorex and was then seen by OMF who \npulled several teeth.  Per patient, she has chronic poor \ndentition and tooth aches.  This is suspicious as a source for \nher bacteremia, but is unlikely given that MSSA is an odd mouth \nflora.  Patient needs a general dentist for oral hygiene as \noutpatient.\n.  \n# Possible UTI: UCx grew out Gentamicin sensitive E. Coli. \nTreatment decision was moot as the E. Coli was covered by \nGentamicin.  \n\n# Chest Pain: Had Chest pain in unit, ruled out, EKG changes \nwere stable.  Had CTA which was negative for dissection. \nResolved with magic mouthwash and ativan.\n.  \n# Prosthetic mitral valve: On warfarin with goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 \nas an outpatient.  After several high and low periods of INR, \nshe became therapeutic, with heparin bridging when low.    \n.  \n# Anxiety: Minimize BZs as became somnolent in the ED with high \ndoses of lorazepam.  \n- Lorazepam 0.5mg PO Q6H PRN  \n.  \n# Pain: Low dose PO opiates for pain as became somnolent in the \nED from high doses of morphine IV.  \n- Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN  \n.\n# Headache:  Patient has been having a headache at home and \ncontinues to complain of headache with fevers.  Likely ___ to \nfevers, as patient has normal neurologic exam, but given high \ngrade bacteremia and high risk, will r\/o septic emboli.  Had \nnormal head CT and MRI that were both negative.   \n.\n# Anemia:  She had labs consistent with MAHA across her mitral \nvalve, and she did require 2 units PRBC on the day of her oral \nsurgery.  Her MCV was low normal, and it was postulated that \nchronic MAHA might have led to iron deficiency anemia.

You had also had 2 episodes of vomiting that looked like coffee grounds. You had a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which did not show any perforation (small hole) in your esophagus. You had another study called a barium swallow, which similarly did not show any perforation. You continued to have stomach pain and nausea, so the GI doctors recommended starting a new medication called hyosciamine. You were given Zofran and Ativan for nausea. We recommended that you try a liquid\/soft food diet. Unfortunately, you continued to feel sick and throw up after eating even on this modified diet. Since we were concerned that you were malnourished, we placed an NG tube and started tube feeds to help you get better nutrition. You were unable to tolerate the NG tube, however, you were able to drink about 3 nutritional supplements a day. Please continue to eat\/drink as much as tolerated. You should drink 4 nutritional supplements\/frappes per day to meet your caloric needs."}

She presented to her PCP's office with \nworsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining \nof nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic \nshe was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the \nED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see \nbelow). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have \nwheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. \nShe was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg \nPO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from \n400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to \nher tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, \nalbuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was \nconsulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 \nmg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns \nfor QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was \n460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, \nand discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was \ndischarged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at \n10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as \nfollow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she \npreviously followed with, Dr. ___. She was also discharged on \n2L supplemental O2 to be worn at all times. \n\n#Atrial fibrillation: Ms. ___ has known atrial \nfibrillation for which she was on amiodarone and apixaban but \nwas found to have HR in the 120s in her PCP's office, prompting \nher referral to the ED. Her COPD exacerbation was the likely \nprecipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, \nparticularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in \nthe ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg \nq6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. \nHer amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was \ndecreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID.\n\n#Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic \nanemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron \n125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron \nwith a bowel regimen. Her H\/H was stable throughout the \nhospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding.\n\nTransitional issues:\n- patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg \nevery 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by \npulmonology\n- patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and \npulmonary rehab.

Your difficulty breathing was due to your COPD flaring. Your fast heart rate was due to your atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rate that can sometimes cause the heart to beat very quickly. Medications that you were taking, such as theophylline, were likely contributing. Your heart rate was lowered using the same medication that you take at home, diltiazem, given through your IV. Your COPD was likely worsened because of a cold. However, your flare was very serious requiring IV steroids and many inhaled treatments."}

While CTA exonerated\npulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion \nwere\nnoted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST\nelevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram \nconfirmed\nsaid effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated.\nHe was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and\ncolchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual \nchest\npain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable\nuntil yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting\npain across his precordium likened to \"wearing shoulder pads\nbearing down on him.\" He notes a new concurrent substernal chest\npain that \"goes straight to his back.\" He then became dyspneic,\nprompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive\nwith SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in\nmild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He\nrapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade\nwithin the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram.\nPericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a\npericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On\narrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable\nbut was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring\nnon-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside\nechocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of \nsmall\nresidual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said\nchest pain. His dyspnea is improving.

CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process  \n2. ___: Exercise stress test  \nINTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of PAD and \n \nLBBB was referred to the lab from the ER following negative \nserial  \ncardiac markers for evaluation of chest discomfort. The patient \nwas  \nreferred for a dipyridamole stress test but due to her \ntheophylline  \ntherapy we were not able to proceed. Due to her frequent atrial \nectopy we chose not to give her dobutamine but had her walk on \nthe treadmill instead. She exercised for 3 minutes of a modified \n___ protocol and stopped due to leg claudication. The \nestimated peak MET capacity was 2.5 which represents a poor \nfunctional capacity for her age. No arm, neck, back or chest \ndiscomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study. The \nST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of \nthe baseline LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated \napbs, occasional atrial couplets and a 6 beat run of PSVT. Rare \nisolated vpbs were also noted. Resting mild systolic \nhypertension with a pprorpriate increase in BP with exercise and \nrecovery.  \nIMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST \nsegments at a high cardiac demand and poor functional capacity. \nNuclear report sent separately.  \n3. ___ CATH:  \nLMCA: short, no CAD. LAD: mild  \nfocal origin disease (20%) and mild proximal disease (30%). LCX: \n \nminimal luminal irregularities. RCA: 30%.  \n4. ECG ___: sinus rhythm with multiple PACs, left axis \ndeviation, old LBBB \n5. ECG ___: Likely atrial tachycardia. Left bundle-branch \nblock. Compared to the previous tracing atrial tachycardia has \nreplaced sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Left \nbundle-branch block was previously noted. \n6. ECHO ___: Conclusions  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure \nis ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There \nis considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular \nejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm\/premature beats. \nTissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular \nfilling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic \nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left \nventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nfrequent atrial ectopy is seen; biventricular function appears \nsimilar.   \n\nMicro: ___: Bcx pending\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBrief Hospital Course\n===========================================================\n___ PMH of CAD, PVD, and COPD presenting with recurrent \nnon-exertional substernal chest pain. The patient has a history \nof mild CAD but labs were significant for negative troponins and \nEKG was without ischemic changes. During her admission, she also \ndeveloped multiple episodes of atrial tachycardia (AFib vs. \nAflutter) and was started on Amiodarone for rate\/rhythm control \nand Rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and kept on home dose of \nDiltiazem also for rate control. She did not have any episodes \nof chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once \natrial fibrillation\/flutter was controlled. She will need to \nfollow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest \npain which led to admission.\n\nAcute Issues:\n========================================================\n#Atrial Tachycardia: During admission pt had runs of wide \ncomplex tachyarrythmia, thought likely supraventricular in \norigin: rapid Atrial Fibrillation\/ Flutter vs. atrial \ntachycardia, with abberancy (complexes with similar morphology \nto native LBBB). She was treated with Diltiazem and Amiodarone \nand had fewer episodes of tachycardia. EP team evaluated patient \nand recommended anticoagulation and outpatient follow up to \nconsider EP study and possible ablation of Atrial Flutter. \nPatient was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor, Amiodarone \n200mg twice daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. \nDiltiazem continued at home dose. Rivaroxaban added for \nanticoagulation. As per outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___, \nplavix was discontinued in light of addition of Rivaroxaban and \ninterest in avoiding triple therapy in this patient. Pt was \ngiven follow up appointments with Drs. ___. She was \nscheduled to see Dr. ___ EP evaluation in 2 months.\n\n#Chest pain: Pt presented with substernal chest pain that \noccurred at rest and was ruled out for MI with no troponin \nelevation or significant new ECG changes. Likely her chest pain \nwas related to periods of tachycardia, although while in the \nhospital the runs of atrial tachycardia did not reproduce chest \npain. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during \nhospitalization, so was discharged once atrial \nfibrillation\/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up \nwith her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which \nled to admission.\n\n#Dry eyes: pt had erythema and pain of R eye, found to have dry \neyes per optholmology. Sent out with Artificial tears and \nerythromycin eye drops. Patient had follow up appointment \nalready scheduled with optholmology and was instructed to attend \nappointment.\n\nChronic Issues:\n=============================================================\n# COPD  Pt appeared to be at baseline respiratory status. She \nwas sent home with her home albuterol neb, albuterol inhaler, \nFluticasone nasal spray, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, \ntiotropium bromide nebs, and theophylline\n\n# PAD: \nAs above, we stopped Clopidogrel as patient is now on \nRivaroxaban and wanted to avoid triple therapy as per her \ncardiologist Dr. ___.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n==============================================================\n1. Patient was discharged on Amiodarone 200 mg po twice daily \nfor one week until ___ and then 200mg po daily thereafter \nuntil her EP appointment with Dr. ___ in approximately 2 months.\n2. Pt was discharged on Rivaroxaban 20 mg qpm with dinner\n3. Pt discharged with outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor with \nresults to be interpreted by Cardiologist.\n4. She presented with chest pain but did not have elevated \nbiomarkers or EKG changes concerning for myocardial damage. \nMoreover, pt remained asymptomatic during periods of \nsupraventricular tachycardia while she was hospitalized. Patient \nmay benefit from outpatient stress test if such symptoms return.\n5. On day of discharge, pt had significant R eye pain and \nredness, was evaluated by Optholmology, who felt that it was \njust dry eyes, treated with erythromycin drops and artifiical \ntears. Patient already has appt w\/ Opthamology in 5 days which \nshe will need to attend.\n\nFull Code\nContact: CONTACT: ___ (husband) ___ ___ \n(daughter) ___ \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She also perseverated about her Ativan and \nAmbien, as well as her propranolol for essential tremor despite \nexplanation that beta blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction \nand respiratory compromise in anaphylaxis.\n\nOn the day she was called out to the floor, the pt complained of \npersistent facial flushing.  She was afebrile, hemodynamically \nstable, and without respiratory compromise or systemic symptoms. \n Symptomatic care with hydroxyzine and eucerin lotion was \nprovided.\n\nUpon step down to the floor, the patient again reported to \nnursing that she felt throat constriction. Epinephrine and \nsolumedrol were given and the patient felt relief. Allergy was \nconsulted, and they asked us to stop all new medications given \nto her while at the hospital, and to report all of them as \nallergies.

Course complicated by AMS due to delirium, \nA fib with RVR, and pseudomonal infection.  She was transferred \nto the floor on ___. Floor course was remarkable for wound \ndehiscence, continued afib with occasional RVR and ongoing \ndelirium. \n\n# Hypotension: Most likely due to volume loss (8hr procedure \nwith persistent oozing) compounded by third spacing from SIRS \nDIC response with hypoalbuminemia and anesthesia with delayed \nrenal clearance and finaly RVR with poor filling time. Estimated \nblood loss was 1L though poorly quantified given the extent of \nthe procedure. Intraop she received 6L crystalloid, 4 PRBC, and \nalbumin (by report though unable to find in OMR), and her post \nop crit nevertheless dropped from 32 to 22.  Post op bleeding \npossible with DIC (INR 1.2->2.4) and thrombocytopenia nadir 39, \nthough there are no outward signs of blood loss- hemostasis was \nnoted at closure, the incisions have been dry with no \nsignificant drains putting out appropriate though dark \nserosanguanous fluid. Patient required pressor support with \nphenylephrine, noepinephrine, and vasopressin post-operatively. \nPatient was empirically covered with vanc\/zosyn briefly, though \nthis was discontinued given no clear source of infection. \nPatient experienced recurrent hypotension on ___ after \nreturning from OR on ___. This was felt to be due to \nintra-operative blood loss and fluid shifts. She received 1U \nPRBCs on ___ intra-operatively and again on ___ due to drop in \nH\/H. BP improved with IVF bolus, blood transfusions, and \nimproved control of A fib with RVR.\n\n# DIC: INR rose 1.2-> 2.4, platelets dipped to 39 with \noccasionaly schistos. This is likely from the procedure, no \nevidence of infection, and it appears to have responded to FFP \nwith stable fibrinogen not requiring cryo. No evidence of \npetichiae, no appreciable oozing from lines and wounds. SQ \nheparin was discontinued, then restarted on ___ once platelets > \n50. Thrombocytopenia improved during ICU course. It gradually \nresolved and normalized by ___.  \n\n# Afib: Previously on warfarin and rate controlled with dilt, \nbridged with lovenox and dilt recently decreased to 120 due to \nsoft systolics during previous admission. Patient was controlled \nwith dilt gtt and was also briefly on amiodarone. Patient was \nthen transitioned to PO metoprolol and diltiazem for ongoing \nrate control. \n\n# Anal Mucinous Adenocarcinoma \nDiagnosed in ___. Restaging ___ showed T4 disease extending  \nbeyond the anal verge, progressing through external muscle of  \nanal sphincter, progression from 3 months ago. Per report she is \nstatus post 5 fractions XRT per Drs. ___, completed \n___. Patient underwent abdominal\/perineal resection with small \nbowel resection with end colostomy, fiducial seed placement and \nperineal closure on ___. Underwent flap debridement, local flap \nadvancement closure on ___. She was started on ancef on ___ \nper plastic surgery, to be continued until all JP drains \nremoved. She was also started on flagyl post-operatively \n___. Deep wound culture from OR on ___ grew Pseudomonas, \nsparse growth, for which she was started on cefepime on ___. She \nwas switched to IV cipro based on sensitivities and antibiotics \nwere discontinued on ___. The Right side JP was removed on ___ \nas well since the opening of wound exposed the JP to air and was \nnot able to hold suction.  The Left side JPs were left in place. \n  \n\n#wound: midline wound dehisced, requiring wet to dry dressing \nchanges daily. It is in the proximity of the ostomy and \napplication of wound vac would be very difficult to manage at \nthis location. we continued with wet to dry dresssing allowing \nit to heal via second intention.\n \n#thromboses: patient with new LUE swelling on ___, found to have \nthrombosis associated with PICC on U\/S. Also has non-occlussive \nL IJ thrombosis, likely secondary to prior trauma line. \nDiscontinued PICC ___ and patient was not anticoagulated, after \ndiscussion with surgery and heme\/onc the decision was not to \nanti-coagulate due to ongoing wound complications and poor \noverall prognosis.   \n\n#AMS: most likely secondary to ICU delirium with waxing and \nwaning mental status. Mental status improved significantly \nduring ICU course and patient was placed on seroquel qhS PRN.  \nThis was continued while on the floor. Her mentation did not \nimprove much and has ongoing delirium. \n\n# Lactic acidosis: Combination of tissue disruption from surgery \nand hypoperfusion from above. Lactate improved with improved BP.\n\n#nutrition: patient with low albumin and pre-albumin levels with \npoor nutrtional status likely contributing to poor wound \nhealing. She was restarted on TFs post-operatively when cleared \nby surgery. She was seen by ___ who recommended soft solids and \nthin liquids, along with supplemental tube feeds. A dobhoff was \nplaced and bridled in the ICU. We continued TF at goal after she \nwas transferred to the floor. She tolerated the TF without \nissues.  \n\n# left ___ finger fracture: no op. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

Normal MRA neck. \n.\nHEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: In the site of prior embolization \nfor \narteriovenous malformation in the left frontal lobe, a 2.4 x 2.5 \ncm hemorrhage has occurred, and has an acute appearance (2:18). \nSuperficial to this, the site of left frontal prior craniectomy \nis identified. There is no significant mass effect or shift of \nnormally midline structures. There is no evidence of herniation. \nThere is no evidence of hydrocephalus. There are coils in the \nleft ICA at the site of previous aneurysm feeding the AVM. The \nvisualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate right maxillary sinus \nopacification as well as bilateral ethmoid sinus opacification. \nSoft tissues are unremarkable. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage involving the left frontal lobe at \nthe site of prior embolization of AVM. Findings posted to the ED \ndashboard at the time of scan completion and marked urgent. \n.  \nNOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The left frontal hyperdensity \nnoted above does not appear to reflect acute hemorrhage. Rather, \nit appears to be a combination of blood pool in dilated vessels, \nembolic material, some degree of vascular calcification, and \nperhaps hemosiderin staining of the brain. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt. was admitted to the Stroke service after an episode where \nshe felt dizzy and off-balance and like she had \"jello legs.\"  \nInitial head CT was read as concerning for some areas of \nhemorrhage around her known L frontotemporal AVM, but on \nattending review it was felt that this was actually a \ncombination of blood pooling in dilated vessels, embolic \nmaterial, some degree of vascular calcification, and perhaps \nhemosiderin staining of the brain (i.e the by-products of the \nradiation she'd received to the AVM).  An MRI of the head was \nperformed to rule out posterior circulation infarct, and was \nnegative for any evidence of acute ischemia (see report above)\n.\nA random Dilatin trough in the ED was 20, and on further review \nwith her in the morning she reported the symptoms started about \n90 minutes after taking her 300 mg evening dose of Dilantin.  On \nexam the next morning she had coarse bilateral end-gaze \nnystagmus and gait ataxia which were both felt to be c\/w \nDilantin toxicity.  Dilantin trough the next morning was 20 \n(corrected to 26.4 given Albumin of 3.4)  She reported that in \nthe last 2 weeks she had started a statin, and had taken 2 \ndifferent antibiotics for pneumonia (Cipro and another she \ncouldn't remember).  It was felt that these added medications \nwere changing her Dilantin metabolism.  Her afternoon and \nevening doses were held, and on HOD #2 her trough was down to \n15.  Her gait was much improved.  Her case was discussed with \nDr. ___ outpatient epileptologist, and her Dilantin \ndose was decreased to 200 mg BID (from ___  She was \nasked to have levels checked twice a week and faxed to Dr. \n___.

No evidence of infection as \npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \nneuro follow-up. \n\n# A. fib: \nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \nNiece in agreement with decision.\n\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\n\n# ___: \nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \nand resolution with IVF.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \n\n# Hypertension  \nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \n\n# Alzheimer's dementia\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \nthis hospitalization.

In goals of care discussion with the patient's \nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

We did a scan of your head and found a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma. This may increase your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an antiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to take twice daily. This benign tumor does not require any surgery to remove or chemotherapy. While you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. This can increase the risk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner to decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, so in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start you on anticoagulation. Your neurologist can re-evaluate this decision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like to revisit this issue."}

There is evidence of \nprior avulsive injury arising off the medial malleolus and \nlikely the lateral malleolus as well. There is chronic deformity \nof the lateral malleolus. No acute fracture is identified. There \nis calcaneal enthesopathy. Soft tissue swelling is noted.\nIMPRESSION: Moderate tibiotalar joint degenerative change. No \nacute fracture appreciated.\n\n___ CT HEAD\nIMPRESSION: \n1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage status post right \ncraniotomy and aneurysm clipping.    \n2.  Hyperdensity of the left posterior cerebral hemisphere not \ncorresponding to vascular territory could conceivably represent \nretained contrast related to the patient's recent myelogram.  \nAttention on followup is recommended.  \n3.  Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia.  \n4. Unchanged position of a right parietal ventriculostomy \ncatheter.  \n\n___\nTECHNIQUE:  Thoracolumbar spine, five views.   \nFINDINGS:  The patient is status post posterior fusion from T10 \nthrough L2 with a T12 corpectomy including placement of a \nvertical fusion spacer.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes \nare incompletely characterized, but suspected, along the facet \njoints along the mid through lower lumbar spine. Small anterior \nosteophytes are present along the lower thoracic spine.  There \nis no evidence for hardware loosening.  A PICC line terminates \nin the upper right atrium.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is also \nnoted. \nIMPRESSION:  Unremarkable post-operative appearance. \n\n___ MRI SPINE\nIMPRESSION: \nStatus post T12 corpectomy and T10-L2 fusion. \nPosterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection \ncommunicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior \nand left lateral displacement of the thecal sac.  This leads to \nsevere encroachment on the distal spinal cord. There are no \nfindings to suggest tumor in this location.  The signal \nintensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather \nthan hemorrhage. \n\n___ 05:14AM BLOOD WBC-22.1* RBC-3.39* Hgb-10.2* Hct-30.8* \nMCV-91 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.3 RDW-17.6* Plt ___\n___ 12:06PM BLOOD Neuts-83.9* Lymphs-8.5* Monos-7.3 Eos-0.2 \nBaso-0.1\n___ 05:14AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 06:45AM BLOOD ___ PTT-30.2 ___\n___ 05:49AM BLOOD Glucose-113* UreaN-27* Creat-0.9 Na-138 \nK-6.6* (HEMOLYZED FROM PICC - falsely elevated) Cl-106 HCO3-28 \nAnGap-11\n___ 04:10AM BLOOD ALT-16 AST-29 LD(LDH)-425* AlkPhos-60 \nTotBili-0.3 DirBili-0.1 IndBili-0.2\n___ 04:10AM BLOOD Hapto-422*\n\n___ 9:01 pm URINE      Source: Catheter. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   URINE CULTURE (Final ___: \n      ESCHERICHIA COLI.    >100,000 ORGANISMS\/ML.. \n         PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION. \n         Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage \nregimen of\n         2g every 8h. \n\n                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in \nMCG\/ML\n                      \n_________________________________________________________\n                             ESCHERICHIA COLI\n                             |   \nAMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S\nAMPICILLIN\/SULBACTAM--   <=2 S\nCEFAZOLIN-------------   <=4 S\nCEFEPIME--------------   <=1 S\nCEFTAZIDIME-----------   <=1 S\nCEFTRIAXONE-----------   <=1 S\nCIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S\nGENTAMICIN------------   <=1 S\nMEROPENEM-------------<=0.25 S\nNITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S\nPIPERACILLIN\/TAZO-----   <=4 S\nTOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S\nTRIMETHOPRIM\/SULFA----   <=1 S\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ w\/ h\/o of stroke ___ years ago with baseline of expressive \naphasia and RLE weakness, although family claims that she can \nfully comprehend. Pt was found to have T12 mass concerning for \nmalignancy in ___, however bx of mass and BM was \ninconclusive.  She was asymptomatic at that time and family \ndecided not to persue further work-up.  Pt now p\/w with a 2.5 \nmonth h\/o of progressive weakness and recurrent falls \nunresponsive to ___, and weight loss from 250-->225.  Pt had CT \nat OSH which demonstrated expanding lesion at T12 and was \nsubsequently given 10mg IV dexamethasone and transfered to ___ \nfor further management.  Patient arrived on the floor afebrile \nand hemodynamically stable.  Immediate neurology and \nneurosurgery consults were obtained.  Her hospitalization course \nis as follows:\n\n# T12 lesion: Patient has profound lower extremity weakness \nbilaterally, some of which is baseline from her previous CVA. \nHer right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and \nclonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke. She \nwas continued on dexamethasone and ISS while on the high dose \nsteroids.  The patient was also given a TLSO brace for \nambulation (although initially in too much pain to ambulate), \nand the head of her bed was kept at <45 degrees.  She received a \npre-op myelogram, consistent with an expanding T12 lesion from \nprior imaging.  She was subsequently taken for decompression \nsurgery by Ortho-Spine Team (s\/p T10-L2 fusion, T12 Corpectomy) \nand transferred to the Ortho-Spine service for post-op \nmanagement for two days.  When she returned to the medicine \nservice on POD2, the patient was unable to move her lower \nextremities bilaterally.  Ortho-spine service indicated that the \npatient required additional pain control.  After consult with \nNeuro-Onc, the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg \nQ8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg BID on POD4.  She was transferred \nto the Neurology service for better management of her leg \nweakness.  It was felt this was likely due to post-op pain and \ninability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia.  \nHer medications were titrated and she did better on a higher \ndose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol \nfor breaththrough pain.  Subsequently her leg movements improved \non better pain control.  She will require XRT for her other bony \nlesions, and will need to follow up in ___ clinic \nafter XRT (to be arranged by XRT).\n  \n# FED\/GI: Patient was found to initially have very mild \nhypercalcemia on admission. She was NPO for procedure and \nstarted on maintenence fluids overnight however did not require \nagressive IVF. At the time of surgery, her hypercalcemia \nresolved.  She was advanced to a dysphagia diet post-operatively \nand did well on that for the rest of her course.  Electrolytes \nwere stable with the exception of potassium which kept returning \nfalsely elevated from hemolosis when drawn off her PICC.\n \n# Foot Fracture: The patient was found to have R foot fracture \ninvolving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension \nto the fifth MTP joint.  This was consistent with repeat imaging \nat ___.  Her L foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt \nwas complaining of additional pain, however, films did not \nreveal any additional acute fractures.  The feet were vascularly \nintact.  Orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the \npatient became ambulatory, otherwise, no intervention necessary. \n\n# Pain: Patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back \nto medicine service on POD2.  Unclear of origin as patient has \ndifficulty communicating due to her aphasia. Patient's pain was \ncontrolled with standing acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycontin, \nfentanyl patch and dilaudid IV PRN.  The pain team was also \nconsulted to help manage her pain.  She was able to come off the \noxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch, and had PO ___ \noxycodone and tylenol for break through pain.\n\n# Encephalopathy: On POD2, there was noted an increase in \naphasia, and confusion, which was difficult to assess given \nbaseline communication issues. HCHCT for acute bleed was \nnegative. The Pt was afebrile and infectious work-up including \nUA was neg. Urine Ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for occult \ninfection.  Her mental status improved with better pain control. \n She got a little worse on ___ and was subsequently found to \nhave a new UTI (E Coli), which improved after treating with \nfirst ceftriaxone and then Bactrim when sensitivies returned \npan-sensitive.\n\n# Hct Drop: The patient Hct dropped from 32 on POD1-->22 on \nPOD2, Hemavac drained only 185cc, pt responded appropriately to \n2U PRBC.  Unclear where bleed is.  Patients Hct subsequent \nremained stable after transfusion.  A T&L MRI revealed:\n\"Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection \ncommunicates through \nthe laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral \ndisplacement of \nthe thecal sac.  This leads to severe encroachment on the distal \nspinal cord.  \nThere are no findings to suggest tumor in this location.  The \nsignal intensity \ncharacteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than \nhemorrhage.\"  Her Hct remained stable and the ultimate source of \nher Hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to \npost-op hemolysis.  The fluid collection was discussed with \northo spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched \nfor now (likely just post-surgical changes).\n\n# History of Stroke: The patient was continued on home dose of \naggrenox until the time of her surgery.  When the patient was \ntransfered back to Medicine on POD2, the aggrenox was held.  It \nwas restarted on ___ at the consent of orthopedics team.\n\n# HTN: The patient was continued on home dose of losartan, \ndiltiazem and atenolol  \n\n# HLD: The patient was continued on her home dose of pravastatin \n\n# ID: UTI discovered ___eveloped foul smelling \nurine and WBC bumped to 22 (but this was felt to partially be \ndue to her dexamethasone as well).  Treated with first \nCeftriaxone, then Bactrim, and culture grew out pan-sensitive E \nColi.  \n\n# Access: Pt had a PICC line placed and confirmed in good \nposition early on in her hopspitalization.  Due to initial \nconcerns with dysphagia and patient frequently spitting out her \nmeds, we decided to keep her steroids IV to ensure she received \nthis crucial medication post-operatively. Once she has started \nradiation therapy, however, the PICC may come out and the IV \nsteroids may be converted to the PO form.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLasix 20 qd\nPravastatin 80 qD\nAllopurinol ___ qD\nColchicine PRN\nAggrenox 25 BID\nCozaar 50 qD\nAtenolol 25 BID\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

A common \nbile duct stent has been placed. \n2. There is persistent bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar \natelectasis. \n3. The multiple large renal cysts in the left kidney and a small \nhypodensity in the right kidney are unchanged since ___. \n\nAbd US and duplex doppler ___:\nNecrotizing pancreatitis with Doppler flow in the superior \nmesenteric vein, portal vein and the majority of the splenic \nvein. No definite flow could be identified within the mid \nportion of the splenic vein, which may be technical, as recent \nCT scan showed small calibre but opacification of this vessel. \n\nCXR ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \nAs compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is \nseen. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the \ncarinal.  The lung volumes remain low.  No pleural effusions.  \nNo pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  The \npreviously placed Dobbhoff catheter has been removed. \n\nCXR ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \nLUNG LOW IN VOLUME BUT CLEAR.

No significant change in the walled pancreatic necrotic fluid \ncollection compared with ___ CT exam.\n2. Interval enlargement of the spleen with severe compromise of \nthe splenic vein and increasing collateral return via the \ngastrocolic trunk suggests development of sinistral portal \nvenous hypertension.\n3. Increased mucosal enhancement in the rectum may reflect \ninfectious or\ninflammatory colitis\/proctitis.\n\n___ CXR: \nProgressive elevation of the right lung base coupled with \nworsening \nconsolidation in the lower lung suggests severe atelectasis. \nThere is also moderate right pleural effusion. The right \nbronchial tree is poorly \ndefined. The findings suggest large scale aspiration or \ndifficulty clearing secretions.  Left lung is clear.  Left heart \nborder is normal. \nLeft PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC. \n\n___ CXR: \nEndotracheal tube has been removed.  The feeding tube and \nleft-sided PICC line are unchanged in position. There are mildly \nlow lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation. There is mild \natelectasis at the lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces. \n\n___ CXR:\nAs compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received \na nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube is located in pre \npyloric position. The middle parts of the tube are slightly \ncoiled in the stomach. The left PICC line is unchanged.  No \nevidence of complications, no pneumothorax.  No pleural \neffusions.  No pneumonia. \n\n___ CXR:\nIn comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian \ncatheter has been pulled back to the region of the junction of \nthe brachiocephalic vein with the superior vena cava. Otherwise \nlittle change. \n\n___ CXR:\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there has been \nplacement of a new left PICC line extends to the mid to lower \nportion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change in the appearance \nof the heart and lung and no evidence of acute abnormality. \n\n___ Abdominal XR:\nThe nasogastric tube has unfolded, remaining within the stomach, \nlikely \nterminating within the antrum or pylorus.  A biliary stent is \npresent.  \nIncluded views of the lung bases are clear. A normal bowel gas \npattern is \ndemonstrated. \n\n___ Right Rib XR:\nNo fracture or dislocation.\n\n___ CT A\/P pancreas protocol:\n1. Absence of pneumobilia is concerning for CBD stent occlusion. \nSuperior \nmigration of the common bile duct stent, now external to the \nduodenal lumen, in comparison to ___ CT with \nduodenal wall within the inferior margin of the stent, is likely \netiology for obstruction. Differential includes stricture at the \nlevel of the ampulla. \n2.  Increased necrosis of a chronic pancreatic collection with \nincreased gas and slightly more organized adjacent collections \nwithin the pancreatic head. \n4. Patent vasculature with persistent narrowing of the SMV, \nsplenic vein, and portal confluence. No thrombus. \n5. Evidence of pancreatitis with heterogeneous enhancement of \npancreatic head\/ uncinate and edema within the \npancreaticoduodenal groove. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ y\/o with PMH significant for type 2 \ndiabetes, schizoaffective d\/o, transferred from OSH for acute \npancreatitis c\/b E.coli bacteremia, intermittent fevers, and \nacute respiratory failure. ___ course further complicated by \nmalignant catatonia and recurrent aspiration.\n\n# Malignant catatonia - Was on ativan and clozapine and \nclozapine at home for schizoeffective disorder. Clozaril was \nstopped at OSH given concern for pancreatitis. Agitation was \noriginally managed with IV haldol in the ICU, but the patient \ndeveloped muscle rigidity and near-catatonia with perseveration. \nPsych was consulted, who felt that his presentation was \nconsistent with malignant catatonia and was likely secondary to \ncessation of clozaril. He was started on IV ativan but his \ncatatonia appeared to be refractory to benzodiazpine treatment. \nHe was then started on a regimen of ECT ___. Amantadine was \nadded at 100mg po BID. With these measures, his catatonia \nresolved. He received 8 total sessions of ECT while inpatient at \n___. His amantadine was weaned to 100mg daily, and his ativan \nwas left at 2mg po every 8 hours. On discharge the patient was \nalert and oriented to person, place, and time with occasional \nconfusion about date and hospital name. He will need maintenance \nECT therapy weekly on ___ for an indeterminate amount of \ntime. His outpatient psychiatrist has been closely involved. His \nnext treatment is at ___ on ___. ***Ativan should be held \npast midnight on scheduled ECT days.\n\n# Acute respiratory failure - Patient had stridorous \nrespirations at the OSH. He was found to have a 6x3 cm hardened, \ndark brown material c\/w hardened or dried oral secretion, which \nwas removed. He remained stridorous after the procedure and was \nintubated for concern of airway protection, which was performed \n___ prior to transfer. CXR showed no infiltrates and no \npulmonary edema. Here he was successfully extubated on ___ and \nwas stable for a week.  He was called-out to the floor on ___, \nand within two hours was stridorous, and a respiratory code was \ncalled. He was re-intubated and bronchoscopy revealed mucous \nplug and thick secretions.  He was started on vanc\/cefipime and \nwas extubated about 12 hours later.  Antibiotics were d\/c'd two \ndays later because infection was not suspected.  He was \ntransferred back to the MICU again to await ECT given concern \nfor decreased airway protection in his catatonic state. He was \nintubated by anesthesia with rocuronium on ___ prior to first \nECT session. Remained intubated for several hours following \nprocedure given his h\/o difficult intubation. Patient was \ntransitioned back to the medical floor on ___ with stable \nrespiratory status. On the night of ___ he became febrile to \n___ and developped respiratory distress requiring \nnon-rebreather. An interval Chest X-ray was suggestive of \naspiration pneumonia.  He was transferred back to the MICU in \nthe morning of ___, where he was intubated and sedated. Broad \nspectrum antibiotics were given. His respiratory status improved \nover several days, and his fevers resolved. His respiratory \nculture was positive for MRSA, so antibiotics were narrowed to \nVancomycin monotherapy. He was exubated on ___, and was \nprogressively weaned to 2L nasal cannula. Once called out to the \nmedical floor, the patient re-spiked a fever so cefepime was \nadded back on with vanc to complete a total 7 day course for \naspiration PNA (ending ___. Patient was weaned to room air. \nThe patient was made strict NPO due to aspiration risk. S&S was \nconsulted who recommended a dysphagia diet. Pt was also started \non tube feeds while PO intake was limited. Nutrition and speech \nand swallow continued to follow. Eventually, he passed speech \nand swallow eval and was able to advance to a regular diet. Tube \nfeeds were then discontinued. It is felt that the patient's \naspiration event was likely secondary to airway edema from \nmultiple intubations, and that his edema has healed over time \nwith subsequent improvement in ability to protect his airway. He \nwas discharged on a regular diet, on room air, and without any \nrespiratory concerns. Nutrition should continue to follow his \ncaloric intake. Aspiration precautions should be enforced.\n\n# Acute pancreatitis c\/b pseudocyst, necrosis, and sinistral \nportal hypertension - Etiology appears to be biliary source \nalthough clozapine was considered as a pharmacalogic etiology. \nERCP did not show gallstones and only sludge. Now s\/p ERCP x2 at \n___. Initially a plastic stent was placed which \nmigrated. It was removed and a metal stent was placed on ___. \nLFTs and Tbili improved during hospitalization. Repeat CT \nAbdomen ___ revealed massive splenomegaly concerning for \nsinitral portal hypertension. Hepatobiliary surgery and \nHepatology were consulted and felt that splenectomy was not \nindicated at this time. They recommend follow up with Dr. ___ \n(___) in 2 months with follow up CT abd\/pelvis and \nelective CCY. Because of the patient's prolonged \nhospitalization, ERCP was consulted to evaluate the patient for \nstent removal. A CT pancreatic protocol was performed on ___ \nto evaluate the stent. The stent appeared occluded but due to \nthe patient's lack of symptoms and normal LFTs, it was decided \nto defer stent removal and have the patient see ERCP in clinic \nin 1 month. He will need to see both ERCP and Dr. ___ in \napproximately 4 weeks time.    \n\n# Acute kidney injury - Prerenal versus contrast induced \nnephropathy from multiple CT scans. Resolved with IV fluids.\n\n# Type 2 diabetes - Pt was taking Januvia at home but this was \nstopped in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Hyperglycemia was \nattributed to pancreatitis. The patient was started on a humalog \nsliding scale and lantus, which was uptitrated throughout his \nhospital course as needed (with fluctuation in his po intake and \ntube feeds). On discharge, his lantus dose was 40 units at \ndinner time. This should continue to be titrated based on \nfasting AM and QACHS fingersticks.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets remained in the low 100s \nthroughout hospitalization. Presentation not c\/w HIT. Heparin \ntherapy was continued. Attributed to splenomegaly.\n\n# Frequent falls - Pt unstable and with psychiatric limitations. \nHe had multiple falls in the hospital despite strict fall \nprecautions. He complained of right sided rib pain on one \noccasion, for which an XR was performed, showing no fracture. He \nwas given 600mg ibuprofen, tylenol, and lidocaine patch with \ngood effect. No pain on discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n#He should f\/u with ERCP here for stent removal in 4 weeks. \n#He should f\/u with hepatobiliary surgery (Dr. ___ in ___nd discuss elective cholecystectomy.\n#Continue 2mg po ativan Q8H, amantadine 100mg daily, and ECT \nweekly, next on ___ at ___. \n#He should follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.\n#Continued aspiration precautions.\n#Continued nutrition evaluation\n#Strict fall precautions and intensive ___.\n#lantus 40 units HS plus sliding scale humalog.

CT abdomen performed and suspicious for \nhemoperitoneum; also notable for rectus sheath hematoma. \nTransplant surgery consulted, recommended MICU observation and \ncontinued transfusion support. She was transfused total of 3 \nunits PRBC, 1 bag platelets, 3 units FFP and DDAVP.\n\n# Anemia of acute blood loss\/Rectus sheath \nhematoma\/hemoperitoneum: Bleeding from rectus sheath hematoma in \nsetting of coagulopathy in combination with paracentesis may \nhave contributed to blood loss. Notes suggest hematoma was \npresent in ___ at previous hospitalization. Pt was given \nblood, FFP, DDAVP and platelets in the ICU with improvement and \nstabilization of hematocrit. Her hct remained stable at 34-35 on \nthe floor without recurrence of hemoperitoneum. She completed 5 \ndays of ceftriaxone for possible SBP (___). Subsequent \nparacentesis were done in spot marked by radiology in area with \nfew collateral blood vessels. On CT ___, rectus hematoma was \nslightly smaller and ascites as of simple fluid density, with \ninterval resolution of high density blood since ___ however \nparacentesis ___ still demonstrated high red cell count, \nalthough decreased from admission, indicating resolving \nhemoperitoneum.\n\n# Hypoxia: The patient required ___ liters of oxygen while in \nthe ICU since being given multiple blood products for dropping \nhematocrit in the setting of renal failure and minimal urine \noutput. CXRs showed atelectasis without PNA. Echo with normal \nsystolic function, mod TR, RV dilation. Hypoxia likely ___ \nascites, volume overload and atelectasis. She did not have any \nepisodes of respiratory distress. The patient was taken out of \nbed. Her hypoxia resolved by the time she arrived on the floor \nwithout recurrence during the rest of her hospitalization.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Renal team considered pre-renal vs. ATN \nas etiology of her renal failure. Abdominal US without \nhydronephrosis. Hepatorenal a possibility, but a diagnosis of \nexclusion per ICU team. The patient had low UOP on the night of \nadmission and was given lasix 80 mg IV with a fair response. \nRenal suggested albumin 25g BID in order to increase her oncotic \npressure. UOP rose to ___ cc per hour on the day of transfer \nto the floor. On the floor, she was treated for hepatorenal \nsyndrome and her Cr slowly improved (peak 4.0 --> 1.4). Albumin \nand octreotide were eventually stopped with continuation of \nmidodrine given SBP 90's. Pt's creatinine increased again to 2.5 \n with fevers raising concern for worsening HRS in setting of \ninfection. Renal was consulted, and felt that urinary \nsedimentation was most consistent with ATN although prerenal \nproblems and HRS could contribute. She was \n Midodrine was continued and octreotide restarted. She again \nreceived albumin 25mg IV BID from  ___ to ___ for HRS in \nsetting of presumed SBP (see 'fevers' below). \nHer kidney function improved and Cr was 2.2 on discharge. She \nwill require close outpatient follow up of kidney function and \nhas labs ordered for ___ which will be followed up by her \nPCP. Her PCP can decide based on her Cr whether she can restart \nher diuretics. Her INR had also trended up during her \nhospitalization to 2.4. She was given 5mg p.o vitamin K prior to \ndischarge for reversal and her INR should be followed up by her \nPCP on her labs of ___.\n.\n# Altered mental status: The patient had altered mental status \non admission. Possible etiologies included hepatic \nencephalopathy, uremia, and delirium due to metabolic causes. \nShe was started on rifaxamin in addition to her lactulose. Her \nmental status improved on the day of transfer to the floor. She \ncontinued to have minor asterixis on the day of transfer, but \nwas more alert and oriented. On the floor, her asterixis \nresolved and she remained AOx3 without recurrence of \nencephalopathy. She was continued on lactulose and rifaximin. \n\n# Alcohol induced hepatitis\/hepatic cirrhosis - acute \ndecompensation likely precipitated by relapsed alcohol abuse. \nHer LFTs improved since admission. Hepatic encephalopathy \nresolved. EGD ___ with erosive gastritis and portal \nhypertensive gastropathy but no varices. She was continued on \nlactulose and rifaximin. Diuretics were held given her renal \nfailure and can be restarted as outpatient. Nadolol held as she \nwas hypotensive and can be started as outpatient although she \nmay not need it as no varices on most recent EGD (done prior \nadmission ___. Of note, splenomegaly increased (13cm-->16cm) \non CT from ___ to ___. Should be followed up as outpatient.\n\n#Fever- Pt had low grade fevers early in her hospitalization, \nattributed to alcoholic hepatitis. Cultures negative and fevers \nresolved. Later in her hospitalization (___), she again \ndeveloped low grade fevers with Tmax 99.5-100. These were \nattributed to viral URI. Para negative for SBP ___ by cell count \nbut given fevers, increased WBC in peritoneal fluid, and \nhemoperitoneum which is risk factor for infection, she began \nempiric treamtment SBP (started cipro 500mg BID (day 1= ___ \nwith albumin x2. WBC in peritoneal fluid on ___ improved from \n___ and cultures negative. On ___, she developed increased \nfevers with T 101-102 with new leukocytosis with left shift. ID \nwas consulted and felt this was possible superinfection of her \nknown rectus hematoma or hemoperitoneum. Antibiotics were \nbroadened to vanc\/flagyl\/cefepime (day 1= ___. She was \ngiven albumin x2 on ___ and ___ for presumed SBP to prevent \nHRS. Imaging was negative for pneumonia, loculation in abdomen, \nor cholecystitis. Cultures were negative. Her fevers improved \nand leukocystosis and differential normalized. She was \ndischarged on SBP prophylaxis with bactrim as she developed \nfever during treatment for SBP on cipro.\n\n# EtOH abuse. Actively drinking prior to admission. Later in \nhospitalization, pt denied drinking prior to hospitalization and \nstated she became ill because she was weak. Pt continued on MVI, \nfolic acid and thiamine. Social work discussed alcohol use with \npatient. She will require close outpatient follow up for relapse \nprevention. \n\n# Liver mass and omental masses. Noted on a consult note from \nOSH. Sister has been told of this at OSH. Films from OSH and \ncurrent studies were obtained and reviewed with radiology. These \nmasses are not apparent on CTs (all without contrast) nor MRI in \nour system. AFP negative in ___. Pt will require MRI with \ncontrast as outpatient to definitely evaluate this.\n\n# Rib fractures - Noted on imaging. Pt denies falls, trauma, \nabuse. Unclear chronicity.

During the procedures to evaluate the fluid in your belly, you had some bleeding. You were given blood with improvement in your blood counts. You also had inflammation of your liver due to alcohol use (alcoholic hepatitis) which occurred on top of your known scarring of the liver (alcoholic cirrhosis), which is what led to the collection of fluid. You had some injury to your kidneys which improved. You had some low grade fevers and were treated for a possible infection of the fluid in your abdomen. Just before you were set to leave, you had a higher fever requiring a longer course of stronger antibiotics. While you have become better in the hospital, continued improvement will be dependent on you. It is VERY important that you do not drink alcohol. You had extensive nutrition counseling in the hospital. You should continue to eat high calorie and high protein meals with supplements such as Ensure."}

There \nare simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic \naorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. There is a 0.3cm by 0.3cm mobile \nechodense structure (see cell 17) on the LVOT side of the aortic \nvalve that may be a small vegetation (orLambl's excrescence). \nThe mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Possible small aortic valve vegetation; no aortic \nregurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.\n.\nMRI OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE. \n  \nCLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of epidural abscess. \n\n  \nCERVICAL SPINE: \n  \nTECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient \necho axial \nimages were obtained before gadolinium. T1 sagittal and axial \nimages were \nobtained following gadolinium. \n  \nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of epidural abscess seen in the \ncervical \nregion. No abnormal intraspinal enhancement is identified. At \nthe \ncraniocervical junction and C2-3, degenerative disease is \nidentified. \n  \nAt C3-4 mild irregularity of the endplates is identified without \nabnormal \nsignal within the disc or enhancement to indicate discitis. \nMild-to-moderate \nleft foraminal narrowing seen. \n  \nAt C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7, mild disc bulging and posterior ridging \nidentified \nwithout spinal stenosis. The spinal cord shows normal intrinsic \nsignal. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No definite signs of epidural abscess, discitis, or \nosteomyelitis. \n2. Mild increased signal in the prevertebral soft tissues in the \ncervical \nregion without distinct fluid collection. This could be due to \nfluid within \nthe nasopharynx. If the patient has trauma, mild prevertebral \nedema can also \nhave a similar appearance. Clinical correlation recommended. \n3. Mild multilevel degenerative changes. \n  \nTHORACIC SPINE: \n  \nTECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial \nimages of the \nthoracic spine were obtained before gadolinium. T1 sagittal and \naxial images \nwere obtained following gadolinium. \n  \nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis or \nepidural abscess \nseen in the thoracic region. No abnormal enhancement identified. \nMild \nposterior ridging of the mid lower thoracic vertebral bodies \nidentified which \nappears to be congenital in nature. Mild multilevel degenerative \nchanges are \nseen. The spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal without \nextrinsic \ncompression. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes. No evidence of discitis, \nosteomyelitis or epidural abscess in the thoracic region. \n  \nCOMMENT: A small amount of fluid is seen in the atlanto-odontoid \nand \natlantoaxial joint anteriorly which could be due to degenerative \nin nature. \n   \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nA\/P: ___ yo M with GPC bacteremia with septic arthritis of L \nshoulder and electrolyte abnormalities.  \n.  \n# Group C Strep Bacteremia\/Endocarditis: Initially with sepsis \nphysiology though was stable upon arrival to the medicine floor. \nWas not hypotensive in MICU. Obvious cause is group C strep \nbacteremia, likely source is L toe ulcer that is also growly \ngroup C strep. Neck pain was concerning for abscess, but MRI \nhere did not show evidence of this, patient continued to refuse \nany further neck imagining despite continued decreased ROM of \nhis neck.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done which was negative, \nhowever, TEE was performed showing evidence of an aortic valve \nvegetation.  Group C strep was found to be ceftriaxone sensitive \nfrom the OSH.  In addition, patient had shoulder washout on \nadmission to the hospital, cultures from that continued to be no \ngrowth to date.  Patient was treated with ceftriaxone, and sent \nhome for a total of 6 weeks of therapy (PICC line placed while \ninhouse).  He was hemodynamically stable throughout his \nadmission.  \n.\n# L foot ulcer: Patient had non-healing ulcer, swab positive for \ngroup C strep, and this likely represents the source of his \nbacteremia.  He was followed by podiatry and vascular surgery in \nhouse. He had two bedside debridements by podiatry. He \nadditionally had non-invasive arterial studies that were normal \nwith good flow.  He will be followed by Dr. ___ in podiatry as \nan outpatient.  His toe was treated with wet-to-dry dressing \nwith silvedine and post-op boot while inhouse. \n.  \n# Septic Arthritis: Patient has been bacteremic with group C \nstrep, which is has likely seeded the L shoulder synovial space \nvia hematogenous spread. He is now s\/p washout by ortho though \nno growth from joint fluid.  He has a history of gout, but an \nacute gouty flare in this joint is uncommon without multiple \nother joints being affected and the findings of pus on washout \nis also inconsistent with gout. Also concern over persistent \nneck pain and evolving abscess or seeding as above. He was \ncontinued on ceftriaxone for a total of 6 weeks as above.  He \nrefused any further head or neck imaging throughout his stay.  \n.  \n# Acute renal failure: Patient with creatinine bump from 0.8 to \n1.2 overnight during admission. Baseline prior since admission \nappears to be around 0.6-0.8. Patient maintained good UOP until \nhis last day of admission at which time he had urinary urgency \nand hesitancy with a positive bladder scan.  He did have \nbilateral hydro on an OSH renal US, and a repeat renal US was \nperformed showing unchanged mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis.  As \nthe patient had difficulty urinating, likley due to BPH, he was \nsent home with a foley\/leg bag with urology follow up as he \nrefused to stay any longer for further work up.  UA, ucx and \nurine eos were negative.  Creatinine decreased to baseline prior \nto discharge. \n.  \n# Transaminitis: Found on admission, resolved without \nintervention.  Unclear etiology. Most concerning was that the \npatient may be throwing septic emboli. Otherwise, etiologies \nincluded congestion from sepsis, drug induced hepatitis \n(although level of transaminitis is quite low), CBD pathology \n(but TB is wnl). Most likely secondary to dehydration from \nevolving sepsis on admission.  Abd ultrasound done was c\/w fatty \nliver or other liver disease which cannot be excluded, though no \nevidence of emboli. \n.  \n# Hyponatremia: On admission. Resolved after hydration. Patient \nlikely was dehydrated given infection. Improvement in BUN as \nwell.  \n.  \n# HTN: Restarted low dose lisinopril on ___ given hypertension. \nHe was continued on 5mg daily on discharge. \n.  \n# DM2: Holding metformin and glyburide, also on lantus at home \n(20u QHS). Given low POs and post-surgical washout, was placed \non insulin ss initially. Lantus was restarted.  Blood sugars \nshould be followed as an outpatient. \n.  \n#CODE: FULL  \n.  \n#COMMUNICATION: patient  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetformin  \nGlyburide  \nlisinopril  \nprotonix  \ncolace  \nASA 81  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Imaging studies showed multiple blood clots in both lungs, known as pulmonary embolism. You were treated with clot destroying medication and later blood thinning medications called heparin. You are now being treated with coumadin and will continue with supplemental lovenox until your INR (blood thinning level) is at the correct level. Because of the clot destroying medicines, you developed a hematoma in your right arm. Your hematoma was treated with pressure wrapping, elevation and ice. The hematoma grew slightly at one point and was evaluted by our hand surgery team who deemed it to be stable. You will be able to start work on ___. You will be able to resume normal activities without restrictions except no contact sports while on coumadin. You will need your INR checked twice a week for the first ___ weeks. After your INR levels stabilize you will then need to check your INR once a week thereafter. Over the next month you will have probably 2 appointments a week (including getting INR checked)."}

CT head negative, CTA head and neck with no thrombus \non admission. MRI Brain performed without acute findings. His \nsymptoms gradually resolved over the course of his stay and he \nwas discharged with outpatient ___. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==================\n[ ] Follow up hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine dose increase ___ \nfrom 75mcg to 100mcg, after lab findings of elevated TSH (28) \nand low free T4 (0.7). Needs repeat TSH\/FT4 in ___ weeks \n[ ] Follow up on neurological symptoms. His L sided weakness and \nsensory deficits had resolved by time of discharge \n[ ] F\/u blood glucose, he was discharged on his home ___ \n___ at meals with ISS per ___\n[ ] For his MRI, his freestyle ___ was removed. He may require \nreplacement as an outpatient. \n[ ] Follow up re: BPPV symptoms. \n[ ] Follow up re: L forearm-hand peripheral neuropathy, \nalleviated by capsaicin cream. He was continued on gabapentin \n600mg BID as an inpatient. \n[ ] Follow up on joint\/tailbone pain, exacerbated by poor \nweather. \n[ ] Follow up uric acid level. He was given 1 dose of \nallopurinol at discharge after his AM labs showed uric acid 7.5. \nWill need repeat level at next appointment. \n[] Discharge weight 296lbs (134Kg), increased throughout \nhospitalization. Follow up weight, consider increasing dose of \ndaily Lasix if needed\n\nACUTE ISSUES\n============\n#L sided weakness, numbness\n#L homonymous hemianopsia\n#H\/o prior CVA\nPresented with left-sided weakness and diminished sensation. No \nacute stroke was seen on CT\/CTA imaging, despite what would be a \nlarge territory infarct given profound ipsilateral facial and \nupper and lower extremity symptoms. Neurology was consulted and \nhad low suspicion for new event. Hypoglycemia was considered, as \nthis can cause recrudescence of stroke symptoms; however, his \nsymptoms persisted even with correction of blood sugar. B12 and \nTSH\/T4 were also obtained; he was noted to be somewhat \nhypothyroid, even with medications, and we increased his dosage \nfrom 75mcg to 100mcg. He was placed on telemetry; no events were \nnoted. With approval from our EP team and his outpatient \ncardiologist, an MRI brain was performed, with read notable for \nno evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or edema. He \ncontinued to work with our ___ team. His symptoms gradually \nresolved throughout his stay, with full upper extremity strength \nat discharge and waxing\/waning ability to walk on his LLE. There \nwas low concern for an acute stroke or TIA; the primary team, \nneurology, and psychiatry found that his presentation is most \nconsistent with functional neurologic disorder, with possible \nrecrudescence of stroke symptoms given hypoglycemia and low \nthyroid. He should follow up as an outpatient for further \nmanagement of symptoms. \n\n#Hypoglycemia in setting of Insulin-dependent Type 2 Diabetes \nMellitus \nHis A1c in ___ was 8.7%. His home insulin regimen is 70\/30, \n100 units 3 times daily. He was reportedly taking in much less \np.o. in the setting of his persistent vertigo, which may explain \nhis hypoglycemia. No symptoms of other common causes of \nhypoglycemia, eg infection or adrenal insufficiency, were found. \nNo insulin was given on admission, and he was started on 50% of \nhis dose the next morning. ___ was consulted \nand his insulin regimen was adjusted per their recommendations. \nHis home metformin was held but restarted on discharge. His \ndischarge regimen was home ___ ___ at meals with ISS \nper ___. \n\n#Anxiety\nPsychiatry was consulted regarding his increasing anxiety, and \nwere also made aware of his ongoing symptoms, potentially \ncontributing to his anxiety. He was given lorazepam prn for \nacute anxiety events. \n\n#Diabetic neuropathy\nHe noted exacerbation of L sided neuropathy from fingers to mid \nforearm. He was given capsaicin cream prn to good effect, and \ndid not note further symptoms throughout the rest of his stay. \nHe also continued on his home gabapentin. \n\n#BPPV\nHe noted worsening vertigo the day prior to discharge, similar \nbut reduced in intensity as compared to previous events. He \nnoted that he had been given meclizine prior to good effect. He \nstated that he felt okay to move around, with the main symptom \nbeing that he saw double if something was held close to his \nface. He was given meclizine. He was able to ambulate without \nissues at time of discharge. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n#Depression\nHe was continued on home ziprasidone.\n\n#CLL\nHe brought in his venetoclax from home, and was continued on his \nregimen. He was given allopurinol on discharge given a slight \nincrease in uric acid levels. \n\n#HTN\nContinued on home losartan and metoprolol. He was also continued \non home furosemide with furosemide prn for ___ edema and increase \nweight. He should follow up as an outpatient for weight check \nand possible uptitration of Lasix. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Prominent \nventricles and sulci are \nunchanged and compatible with mild global age-related volume \nloss.  Basal \ncisterns are preserved.  There is no shift of normally midline \nstructures. Hypoattenuation in the periventricular and \nsubcortical white matter is unchanged and likely sequelae of \nchronic microvascular ischemic disease.  Gray-white matter \ndifferentiation is preserved.  No calvarial fracture is \nidentified.  There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air \ncells, with tiny air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses.  The \nremainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells \nand middle ear cavities are clear. \nIMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial injury. \n\n___ CT CHEST W\/O CONTRAST\nFINDINGS:  Scarring and bronchiectasis within the right upper \nlobe is \nunchanged in appearance and likely the sequela of this patients \nsarcoid.  \nRight upper lobe chain suture reflects prior wedge resection.  \nMultiple new peribronchovascular nodules are predominantly basal \nand peripheral, some of which show a characteristic flame-shaped \nappearance (4; 113).  For example, a right lower lobe nodule \nabuts the pleural surface, contains an air bronchogram, and \nmeasures 2.8 x 2.3 cm;  a left lower lobe nodule also contains \ntraversing air-filled bronchi and measures 2.5 x 1.8 cm.  The \npleural surfaces are normal.  The airways remain patent and \nnormal appearing, with a small amount of adherent mucus within \nthe trachea.   \n  \nCentral lymph nodes are mildly enlarged from the prior study, \nincluding a \n1.5-cm right lower paratracheal node, a 9-mm prevascular node, \nand a 1.3-cm subcarinal node.  The heart is normal in size \nwithout pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are normal in \nsize and configuration.  A physiologic amount of fluid is seen \nin the posterior superior aortic recess.  There is moderate \ncalcification of the visualized coronary arteries. \n  \nWhile this exam is not tailored for evaluation of structures \nbeneath the \ndiaphragm, it shows prominent retrocrural lymph nodes.  The \nthyroid gland is normal appearing.  There is moderate thoracic \nspinal degenerative disc change. Compression deformity of the \nT12 vertebral body is similar in appearance to the chest \nradiograph performed ___, but new from ___. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1.  Marked increase in basilar and peripheral prominence of \nperibronchovascular nodules, some of which have a characteristic \nflame-shaped appearance suggestive of sarcoid, however, in the \nclinical setting of leukocytosis and fever, infection cannot be \nexcluded. \n2.  T12 wedge deformity, unchanged from ___ and \nnew from ___. \n\n___ ECHO \nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure \nis ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). \nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). \nTissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular \nfilling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the \nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no \nmitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is \nseen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is \nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity \nsize with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male w\/ PMH of sarcoidosis, sleep apnea on CPAP, \nnew-onset dementia of unknown etiology, hx of ITP s\/p distant \nsplenectomy presents to ED after falling at home in the setting \nof rapid progressive cognitive decline for the last six months, \nintermittent fevers and leukocytosis for ___ years, and recent \npna.   \n  \n# Confusion: per wife's report, confusion started worsening more \nrapidly during the last 6 months, but also in setting of being \ndiagnosed with influenza\/pneumonia in ___. \nPer wife, his mental status waxes and wanes and sometimes in \nrelation to fevers. An extensive workup was done at ___ \n___ during his last hospitalziation (discharged on ___ \nfor pneumonia, influenza, confusion) and was attributed to toxic \nmetabolic encephalopathy (TME) secondary to influenza and \npneumonia with underlying dementia over past 6 months which has \nprogressed. Evaluated by Neurology during that admission - EEG \nshowed no seizures, MRI showed chronic small vessel infarcts but \nno acute disease, Vitamin B12, TSH, RPR, lead level were normal. \nLP was deferred. Infectious workup here so far been negative \n(urine culture negative, blood cx with no growth to date, LP \nunremarkable with negative HSV, cryptococcus, and CSF culture), \nhowever CXR with possible pna vs. sarcoidosis flare. CT chest \nobtained showing new prominent markings of pulmonary nodules. \nConcern for infection vs. neurosarcoidosis\/sarcoid flare given \nacute progression of his dementia, immunosuppresed with disease \nprocess, self-discontinuation of prednisone for one month, and \nleukocytosis with intermittent fevers\/rigors. Leukocytosis has \nbeen occurring for about ___ years, but his white count has not \nbeen as high previously, which was concerning for an acute \ninfection or acute sarcoid flare. \n\nNeurosarcoid was unlikely as no typical MRI changes and no \ncranial nerves involvement. Patient also without any neuro \ndeficits on physical exam and LP opening pressure was normal at \n15cc. Leukocytosis, intermittent fevers, hypercalcemia, and \nrecent 20# weight loss in the past year also concerning for \npossible malignancy. Per OMR, patient had extensive workup for \npossible lymphoma including biopsy with Dr. ___ was all \nnegative. CSF cytology, SPEP, and UPEP were negative during this \nadmission. HIV also negative. \n\nThe pulmonary and rheumatology teams were consulted and both \nteams agreed that the patient could be having a sarcoid flare. \nAs a result, he was started on prednisone 60mg on ___ with \nclose follow up with rheumatology. He was also started on \nprophylactic alendronate weekly and PCP ppx with bactrim. At \ndischarge, patient was afebrile, asymptomatic, with mental \nstatus at baseline. \n\n# cough\/leukocytosis\/intermittent fevers:  \nLeukocytosis\/intermittent fevers appears chronic and going in \nfor about ___ years as per above. Per wife, various workup in the \npast and attributed to sarcoid +\/- steroids. Patient was \nrecently diagnosed with PNA\/influenza and completed treatment \nwith tamiflu and long course of cefpodoxine for pna. \nDifferential also includes possible sarcoids flare as per above \nsince patient has not been taking prednisone for last 1 month. \nCT chest with new prominence of nodules but per pulmonary team \nlow suspicion for infectious process. Infectious workup \nincluding LP not suggestive of infection, thus attributed to \nsarcoid flare. Started on prednisone 60mg daily. Will follow up \nwith rheumatology who will determine length of prednisone.  \n\n# Sarcoidosis: c\/b uveitis, ileocolitis, and pulmonary \ninvolvement. Patient self-discontinued prednisone for 1 month. \nHas no seen Dr. ___ since ___.   \n\n# recent falls: previous falls per history appears mechanical \n(falling off the ladder and loosing balance when transferring \nfood from the refrigerator shelves). Fall on day prior to \nadmission most likely a vaso-vagal episode as he vomited, felt \ndizzy, and then fell in the tub. Unclear if loss consciousness \nas wife found him in the tub. Denied any palpitations, cp, \nurine\/bowel incontinence, abnormal body movements, or weakness \nto suggest cardiac, seizures, or stroke. Negative orthostatics \non ___, no events on telemetry for 24 hours. CT head w\/o \ncontrast without signs of bleeding or acute intracranial \nprocess. ___ and OT evaluated patient and recommended discharge \nto home. \n\n# Pyuria: Received CTX x1 in ED for presumed UTI. Patient was \nasymptomatic, thus treatment was not continued. Urine culture \nwith no growth. \n\n# Acute kidney injury: On admission Cr. 1.3. Likely secondary to \ndehydration and decreased PO intake. Given IVF in ED and another \nliter overnight and creatinine returned to normal. At discharge, \ncreatinine was 1.   \n.  \nINACTIVE ISSUES:  \n# Depression:  continued on home fluoxetine   \n# HLD: continued on home statin\n\n# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n-unclear etiology of acute worsening confusion, leukocytosis, \nand intermittent fevers, but may be secondary to systemic \nsarcoidosis. Prednisone increased to 60mg daily with close \nfollow up with rheumatology and pulmonology\n-on bactrim and alendronate while on prednisone\n-CSF cytology negative for malignant cell, negative crypto, \nnegative fungal and viral culture.

Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass \nopacities, \nbronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula \nand right \nmiddle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays \nand CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening \nbronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change \nrapid enough to suggest pneumonia. Of course pneumonia might be \npresent and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the \nbasis of clinical findings. \n2. Stable mild cardiomegaly. \n3. Moderate emphysema. \n4.

Additional hypoxia work-up notable for \nnegative biomarkers, negative LENIs; unable to perform CTA due \nto chronic kidney disease and creatinine 2.8. Patient was able \nto be weaned back to room air by the end of her FICU stay. She \nwas transferred to the medical floor on ___, where she \ndemonstrated exertional hypoxia, usually asymptomatic. Home O2 \nwas arranged.\n.\n# Post-obstructive pneumonia. Consolidation of left lower lobe \nevident on ___ likely secondary to infection rather than \nprogression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate \ndevelopment (although on CT scan of ___, the radiologist \nconcluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by \nher NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out). \nContinued course of ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, which was \neventually narrowed to levofloxacin alone. Blood cultures no \ngrowth to date. Multiple sputum cultures obtained; however, all \ncontaminated with oral flora. Urine legionella negative. Patient \ndid improve clinically with antibiotics, so she should complete \na ___ day course of levofloxacin.\n.\n#  NSCLC- stage IV. Not currently receiving chemotherapy.  \nOutpatient oncologist Dr. ___ is planning on continued \nsurveillance with plan for possible further palliative systemic \nchemotherapy if symptomatic progression of her disease is noted. \nCT scan for evaluation of disease progression was obtained and \ndid show further progression. Dr. ___ plans to weigh the risks \nand benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be \ncomplicated by her kidney dysfunction and other comorbidities. \nHe plans to repeat her CT scan once she completes her \nantibiotics to further evaluate the rate of disease progression.\n.    \n#  CAD s\/p MI. Patient without chest pain; however, EKG with new \nST-depressions. Biomarkers cycled and negative x2. Patient \ncontinued on home beta-blocker at a decreased dose due to \nrelative hypotension. She was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and \nstatin.\n.\n# chronic systolic CHF (LVEF ___ by TTE ___: \nWell-compensated. As described below, lasix was held but \nB-blocker was given at a lower dose given relative hypotension \nand exertional tachycardia.\n.\n#  CKD stage III: Creatinine on admission 2.8, down to 2.4 by \nthe time of discharge. She was given minimal IV fluids in the \nICU and her lasix was held. Throughout stay, patient had \nadequate urine output. \n.\n#  Microcytic anemia. On presentation, patient's Hct likely \nhemoconcentrated. Follow-up Hct found to be 20. No signs of \nbleeding on exam. Patient transfused 2units of pRBC due to \nhistory of CAD with appropriate elevation in hematocrit. The \nhematocrit did remain steady during FICU course following \ntranfusion. Just before transfer from ___, the patient's stool \nguaiac was positive, which may call for further work-up.

Two similar episodes in the \npast that resolved once spontaneously and once with IVF. Work-up \nin the past include negative stress test, normal EKG, and normal \ncardiac biomarkers. Previous episode thought to be associated \nwith vasovagal. This episode also not due to ACS given atypical \npresentation, no ischemic changes on EKG and negative cardiac \nenzymes x2.  Patient also denied chest pain. Food poisoning or \ngastroenteritis also unlikely in the absence of diarrhea or \nabdominal pain, and her symptoms were different from \npresentation of norovirus in ___. In the setting of newly \nfound adnexal mass, weight loss, and ? early satiety, a \nparaneoplastic gastroparesis is a possible. Most likely, \nhowever, pt was dehydrated as she admits to minimal water \nintake, had lactate of 5.7 that improved to 1.7 with IVF, and \nsymptoms also resolved after receiving 2.5L IVF.  In addition, \npatient was orthostatic on admission by heart rate, further \npointing to volume depletion.  She was no longer orthostatic by \nthe time of discharge. \n\n# Ovarian lesion.

Initially elevated WBC to 19 with normal \ndifferential and no atypical cells.  Patient has been afebrile \nand has no localizing signs to suggest an infectious process. \n___ also be secondary to a possible paraneoplastic syndrome \nsecondary to ovarian malignancy, however, presence of malignancy \nis not confirmed. No new medications as potential cause. Heme \nmalignancy unlikely given normal Hct and platelet and normal \ndifferential. This was likely partially due to hemoconcentration \nas all cell lines trended down after IVF.  WBC on discharge was \n14.5.\n\n# HTN. Orthostatic by heart rate but not blood pressure on \nadmission.  Initially held amilodipine and HCTZ.  Patient \nslightly hypertensive on morning of the day of discharge, BP \n140\/70s.  Restarted amlodipine, but held HCTZ in the setting of \nits likely contributing to volume depletion.\n\n# HLD. Continued home does simvastatin.\n\n# T2DM.

She improved significantly and was \ntransitioned from scheduled nebs to scheduled albuterol inhaler \nwith PRN nebs. She felt significantly improved and was \ndischarged home. She will complete 5 day prednisone burst and \nzpack. She was prescribed a nebulizer machine for home, since \nshe has difficulty inhaling albuterol when her symptoms worsen. \nShe was provided with a spacer for her inhaler, a peak flow \nmeter, and incentive spirometer, and teaching on using these. \nRecommend PFTs as outpatient and consideration of long acting \ninhalers. It was felt that her laryngoscopic findings of \noropharyngeal, arytenoid, and pharyngeal erythema at ___ were \nlikely due to a viral illness given their improvement and \noccurrence along with other viral symptoms. She will continue \nher prior daily PPI.

We suspect that your symptoms were due to a viral infection that caused a flare of your COPD. Your symptoms improved with nebulizers, steroids, antibiotics, and cough medications. We recommend 2 more days of the steroids (prednisone) and antibiotic (azithromycin), and a week of cough medication if you are still having a cough. We have also prescribed a nebulizer machine that you can use at home. We only recommend using this if you are too short of breath to use your albuterol inhaler effectively.

She had some evidence \nof volume overload on CXR and physical exam, in the setting of \ndiscontinuation of her furosemide for the past week or so as \nwell as atrial fibrillation prior to admission.  Her furosemide \nwas stopped by her cardiologist due to concern for overdiuresis \nand elevated creatinine.  Her history of increasing DOE over the \npast 3 days is congruent with this timeline.  She was diuresed \nwith IV furosemide on admission with robust response of over 3L \nnegative.  In addition to restarting her PO furosemide at 40mg \n(her previous dosing), IV diuresis was continued until the \npatient was more comfortable, titrated off supplemental O2, and \nphysical exam had minimal crackles.  She was also continued on \nher anti-heart failure medications, including her B-blocker and \n___, with good blood pressure control as well.  Her previous \ndose of Lasix 40mg was restarted on discharge and she was \ninstructed to weigh herself each day to monitor any evidence of \nfluid overload and report to her MD if there were significant \nchanges.   \n.\n# RHYTHM \/ atrial fibrillation: She was admitted on metoprolol \nand digoxin for rate control, after a failed previous \ncardioversion.  She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with \na rapid ventricular rate to the 150s, effectively controlled \nwith IV diltiazem in the ED.  Her metoprolol was gradually \nuptitrated as her resting heart rates were in the ___ to ___, \nbut she would increase to the 130s-140s upon walking short \ndistances.  Metoprolol tartrate was increased to 50mg BID and \nchanged to 100mg metoprolol succinate on discharge.  Her \nambulatory HRs day prior to admission were in the ___.  She was \ncontinued on her home dose of digoxin.  For anticoagulation, she \nwas continued on warfarin, INR goal between ___.  Looking back \nthrough her previous INRs, her last subtherapeutic INR was in \n___, making her a possible candidate for trial of \nrhythm control.  TSH was also checked and normal.\n.  \n# Acute kidney injury: Along with diuresis, we noted a mild \nincrease in her creatinine.  Given her continued symptoms of \nvolume overload, we continued her daily diuresis with her home \ndose of furosemide, with creatinine peaking to 1.5, but trending \ndown to 1.3 on discharge.  We decide to tolerate this mild renal \nfailure to try to prevent future CHF exacerbation.\n.\n# ?Obstructive sleep apnea: - Given that the patient was \neffectively diuresed and continued to have shortness of breath \nin the middle of the night, we believe that an OSA work-up as an \noutpatient is indicated.  She has the body habitus that makes \nher higher risk and this is somewhat of a chronic complaint for \nher.  She does indicate that she has undergone a sleeping study \nbefore, but states that this was quite a long time ago.\n.\n# CORONARIES \/ chest pain: Negative stress test back in ___, \nwithout significant EKG changes or cardiac enzyme elevation on \nadmission. Her cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and she was \nruled out for MI.  Her chest pain characterization of radiation \nto the back was somewhat concerning for an aortic dissection, \nbut the pain was fleeting and when effectively diuresed, her \npain dissipated. She was continued on her ASA and statin.  \n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n.\n# t2DM: HbA1c of 7.3%.  She was previously seen at ___ and \n___ a strict insulin regimen that works for her.  She was \ncontinued on her BID long-acting insulin regimen along with a \nshort-acting insulin sliding scale.\n.  \n# Glaucoma: Patient instructed us that she no longer takes her \neyedrop medications for history of glaucoma\n.\n# Chronic lower back pain: She was continued on Percocet and did \nnot complain of back pain this visit.\n.  \nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n.\n# Med changes - She was started back on her home dose \nfurosemide, knowing that her creatinine was above baseline.  \nGiven that holding furosemide in this setting may have been the \ncause for her current exacerbation, it was decided to continue \ndespite this.  Her creatinine should continue to be monitored.\n.\n# ?Cardioversion - Though she is better rate controlled after \nthis admission, she may be a candidate for another \ncardioversion, given her therapeutic INRs.  We will defer this \ndecision to her outpatient cardiologist.\n.\n# Medical decision making \/ code status:  The daughter would \nlike to take the steps to make her the designated, official HCP. \n Ms. ___ was in agreement that she would be more comfortable \nwith her daughter making her medical decisions for her.  During \nthis hospitalization she was made DNI, but not DNR.  This will \nlikely need further discussion as an outpatient.

The mitral valve appears structurally \nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular \ninflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no \npericardial effusion.  \n*************\n\n___- Carotid Artery Ultrasound:\n1. Less than 40% stenosis in the bilateral internal carotid \narteries. \n2. Prominent homogeneous plaque at the proximal left internal \ncarotid artery. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr ___ was admitted for further workup. His exam was notable \nfor being able to obey simple non-verbal commands, but not ones \nthat required verbal responses with mild right sided weakness. \n.\nThe initial CT showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, with evidence of \nan old small stroke in the Left thalamus, but no acute bleed. He \nwas unable to tolerate lying on his back for the initial MRI, \nand when it was repeated the results were severely limited \nbecause of the significant dental artifact. He became more alert \nover 3 days, but on HD#3 developed increased right sided \nweakness, concerning for a progression of his symptoms and \nevolving intracranial process. A CT\/CT angiogram was done and \ndid not show any parenchymal changes, but did show a possibly \nulcerated plaque in left carotid artery. Follow up ultrasound \ndid not reveal this ulceration, however he clinically appeared \nto have suffered a stroke. An MRI was attempted but of limited \nuse given the patient's extensive dental fillings that caused \nartifact. An LP was also obtained to rule out an infectious \neitiology to explain his symptoms, but this was negative. In \nfurther discussion with the family, it was determined that Mr. \n___ might also have had some slowly progressing loss of verbal \nability, though this was difficult to assess as he primarily \nlived in ___ and spoke with the family only intermittently. \n.\nHe was maintained on higher dose of aspirin (325 mg), and \nstarted on pravastatin for an LDL of 125. ___ therapies \nwere consulted, and they recommended an ___ rehab facility \nto assist with recovery. Given that the patient is originally \nfrom ___, the traveller's insurance that he obtained would not \ncover the expense of an ___ rehabilitation stay. \n.\nThe family was deciding between placing him in a ___ \nrehab facility vs. having him taken care of at home with \nvisiting ___\/ and speech therapy. Ulitmately, they decided to \nbring him home with services to be provided in house. A home \nsafety evaluation was ordered for after discharge. \n.\nFEN\/GI: Initially some concern for aspiration, but was cleared \nby video swallow study for regular vegetarian diet. \n.\nHeme\/CV: Initally home medication of amlodipine was held, but \nwas restarted on HD #5 due to hypertension. The next morning he \nhad an apparent presyncopal episode during physical therapy, and \nhis blood pressures were ___. Thus, his amlodipine dose was \ndecreased by half and he will continue this dose until follow up \nwith his new PCP. \n.\nA follow up appointment with Dr. ___ PCP) and Dr. ___ \n(___) was made for shortly after discharge. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAmlodipine 5md daily\nAsa 75mg daily\nMultivitamin \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n3. amlodipine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at \nbedtime).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. simvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPresumed left fronto\/temporal stroke (unconfirmable by imaging)\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \nor cane).","summary":"You were admitted to ___ following a few days where you had trouble with incontinence, confusion, difficulty walking, and speech arrest. A head CT was done on admission and showed changes related to aging and an old stroke in the region of the brain called the thalamus (on left), but no acute bleed or masses. An EEG was done initially because there was a thought you might be having seizures, but there was just some \"spike\" activity without seizure recorded. A trial of Keppra was done but was stopped because it did not help your clinical picture. On your third hospital day, you developed what appeared to be worsening weakness on your right side, and so a CT\/ with angiogram was done to evaluate the blood vessels in the brain. There were no changes on the CT, but the angiogram showed a possible plaque in the internal carotid artery that could have sent small clots up into the smaller vessels in the brain. An ultrasound of the carotid artery was done and was limited by motion, but did not show evidence of a plaque that could throw clots. A lumbar puncture was done to rule out any infections, and was within normal limits. Over the next few days, you clinically appreared to have suffered a stroke, though the MRI attempt was unsuccessful due to your extensive dental fillings. You were started on high dose aspirin, simvastatin for an elevated LDL, and recieved intensive physical\/occupational\/and speech therapy during the admission. Your speech improved a little bit and you were able to follow simple commands, but you still required much support with walking, which prevented your discharge for a few days. At the time of discharge, you were maintained on HALF the dose of your blood pressure medication (2.5 mg amplodipine daily), and this should be continued after discharge."}

The mass \nwas hypoechoic and heterogeneous in texture. The borders were \nirregular and poorly defined. Both an FNA and FNB were \nperformed, but unfortunately they were nondiagnostic withscant \nparenchymal sampling, stromal fibrosis and atypical ductal cells \nseen. The initial ultrasound showed that the celiac artery \ntakeoff and superior mesenteric artery takeoff were not invaded \nby the mass. The mass also did not seem to involve the portal \nvein or a portosplenic confluence; however, it was in close \nproximity to the SMV, though there was an intact interface noted \nat all levels.  \n - ___: She returned for a second endoscopic ultrasound  \n on ___ and this time pathology from this biopsy showed \n \n pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated.  \n Cytology was also suspicious for malignancy.  \n - ___: She saw Dr. ___ and ___ recommended \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy and CyberKnife.  \n - ___: C1D1 FOLFIRINOX  \n - ___: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX  \n - ___: C3D1 FOLFIRINOX  \n PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \n - Chronic low back pain,  \n - Bipolar disorder,  \n - PTSD,  \n - Anxiety and panic disorder  \n - Hyperthyroidism s\/p surgery  \n - Hypothyroidism  \n - GERD,  \n - Irritable bowel syndrome,  \n - Osteoporosis,  \n - Palpitations  \n - Prior myocarditis  \n s\/p appendectomy,  \n s\/p thyroidectomy,  \n s\/p total abdominal hysterectomy in ___ due to abnormal \nvaginal bleeding,  \n s\/p C-section x 4,  \n s\/p bladder suspension  \n s\/p tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.  \n\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nHer birth mother had breast cancer at an unknown age.

Avoid NSAIDs. Serial hcts. Active \ntype and cross. GI bleeding is unlikely the cause of the \npatient's current hypotensive episodes and warrents further \ninvestigation for a possible infectious cause.

Upper lobe peribronchovascular airspace filling could be \nedema or a manifestation of more severe airspace abnormality in \nthe lower lungs, mostly consolidation, partially atelectasis, \ndue to aspiration, multifocal \npneumonia, or less likely hemorrhage. In the setting of a recent \ntransfusions, transfusion reaction may be contributory.    \n4. Esophageal wall thickening, with diffuse infiltration of the \nmediastinal fat which may reflect inflammatory change or \nconfluent lymphadenopathy, though the progression from normal \nmediastinal contours on ___ favors a rapidly evolving \ninflammatory process. There is no finding to suggest esophageal \nperforation. \n.\n___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a \nmassive increase in extent and severity of multifocal pneumonia. \nThe resulting very widespread parenchymal opacities are more \nextensive on the right than on the left and show multiple air \nbronchograms. In addition, retrocardiac atelectasis has newly \nappeared, and there is a small right pleural effusion. The \nopacities are better displayed on the CTA examination, performed \nyesterday at 9:41 p.m. Moderate cardiomegaly. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old woman with no known medical history who presented \nwith subjective fevers, abdominal pain, and hematemesis and \ndeveloped hypoxic respiratory failure. Clinical picture likely \nconsistent with an initial gastroenteritis with emesis likely \nleading to aspiration pneumonia and hematemesis.\n\n# Hematemesis: EGD revealed mild esophagitis, a non-bleeding 7mm \nulcer in the pylorus, and several superficial non-bleeding \nulcers ranging in size from 3mm to 5mm in the duodenal bulb. \nThis was likely due to aspirin use and recurrent emesis. H. \npylori antibody is negative. Her HCT continued to rise and she \nwas transitioned from a pantoprazole gtt to pantoprazole 40mg PO \nQ12h.   \n\n# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient developed fevers and \nnew hypoxia on ___. She was empirically treated for pneumonia \nwith ceftriaxone. CT chest showed likely multifocal pneumonia \nwhich was possible due to aspiration. Given these findings, \nantibiotics were broadened to vanc\/levo\/flagyl and ID was \nconsulted. The vanc was discontinued on ___ and the patient was \ndischarged with PO levo and flagyl for likely aspiration \npneumonia. Her pulmonary status improved significantly during \nhosptialization and she was satting 100% on RA at discharge.\n\n# Volume overload: the patient received over 12L of IV fluids in \nthe ICU in the setting of hypotension (BP 80\/40s with fever, \nmottled legs, likely sepsis with pulmonary source). After pt \nstabalized, she was gently diuresed.\n\n# Diarrhea\/Abdominal Pain: Likely viral gastroenteritis as this \nresolved during the hospitalization. Stool cultures, including C \ndiff, were negative.\n\n# Tick Bite: Recent tick bite removed quickly. Lyme serologies \nwere negative and smear was negative for babesiosis although   \nANAPLASMA PHAGOCYTOPHILUM was negative.\n.  \n# Transaminitis: Very mild transaminitis (50s). No RUQ pain, no \nhyperbilirubinemia. Likely related to viral \ngastroenteritis\/acute infectious process. \n\nTransitional issues\/INcidental radiographic findings.\n-Pt will require primary care follow up: has not seen a PCP ___ \n___ years. Would follow LFT's as well. \n-Pt has recently decided to stop smoking. Outpatient support \nshould be provided to support this goal.\n-Pt still mildly volume overload at discharge. She was \nmobilizing and self-diuresing effectively and will follow up \nwith PCP closely to see if she would benefit from lasix.\n-___ WAS NOTED TO HAVE ESOPHAGEAL WALL THICKENING ON CT WITH \nCONFLUENT LYMPHADENOPATHY THAT FAVORED AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS. \nThis will likely require further work up\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

It is important that you complete the course of antibiotics for treatment of your pneumonia. Please take Levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth daily and metronidazole 500 mg by mouth every 8 hours for six more days. As you know, you were given many liters of fluids through your veins while you were in the intensive care unit because you were so sick. You will continue to urinate out this fluid within the next several days. Because you vomitted blood, we took a look at your esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestines with a camera. We saw that you have an ulcer in your stomach and several ulcers of your upper small intestine. To help treat your ulcers, it is important that you start to take Prilosec (omeprazole) 40mg twice a day. It is also important that you avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, alleve, and aspirin. You may take tylenol. You developed new diarrhea in the hospital. This is most likely likely due to antibiotics and should resolve as your gut flora return. You can take yogurt or lactobacillus supplements to accelerate this process."}

The ER sent off lyme serologies in CSF fluid and this is \nPENDING at time of discharge (communicated to PCP). Our \nsuspicion for this was low.  After the cultures were negative \nfor 48hours, these were stopped. Pt was told to continue \nsupportive care for his Aseptic Meningitis with rest, fluids, \ntylenol. He remained afebrile here.

MRI is \nmore sensitive for evaluation of metastases.\n\nLeft hip XR (___):\nNo definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to \nevaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.\n\nPortable abdomen (___):\nRadiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a \nnonobstructed\nbowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present \nin the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement \nof the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright \nview is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free \nintraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected \nclinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would \nbe recommended.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, \nincluding lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially \npresented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening \nintrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous \nliver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon \ncancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and \neventually discharged home with hospice.\n\nActive Issues:\n(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary \nembolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission \ndemonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic \ncancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which \nhad evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient \nreluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy \nultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following \ndiscussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was \ntransferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential \ntrial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional \nand nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with \nthe patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus \ngoals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient \nwas discharged home with home hospice. \n\n(2) Left thigh weakness\/spinous tenderness: She was found to \nhave focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse \nspinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of \npreserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted \nto be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying \nmalignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord \ninvolvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural \nabscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic \ncoverage with vancomycin\/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite \nfrequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at \nlumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing \nclaustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.\n\n(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain \nand tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for \nobstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, \nparticularly given episodes of emesis\/hematemesis as below. \nWhile multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen \nwas planned to evaluate for alternative sources of \nintraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple \noccasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol \nas needed.\n\n(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small \nvolume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with \nblood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit \nremained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for \ngastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of \nPPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was \ntrue blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. \nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of \nrecurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. \n\n(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered \nthroughout admission, never oriented to more than person and \nplace, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as \ncompared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including \nblood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent \nCXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for \nacute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion \nof metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia\/MRI \naversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. \nHistory of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible \ncontributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. \nHepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic \nlesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ \nto severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained \nstable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.\n\n(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset \nshortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was \nnegative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could \nnot be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal \ninfiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against \nacute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent \nwith prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. \nShortness of breath resolved over the course of admission \nwithout dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers \nand expectorants as needed.\n\n(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked \nat 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting \nunderlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up \nincluding CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was \nunrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of \nisolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. \n\n(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ \nto ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin \n2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. \nRight upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis \nor obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed \nintraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded \nin the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she \ndeclined CT for further evaluation.\n\n(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout \nadmission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting \ncompromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant \ninfiltration. \n\n(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic \n100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO \nintake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. \nTachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite \nconcurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear \ninfectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental \npulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of \nadmission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she \nwas never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\n(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and \nseeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying \ndepression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and \ntreatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal \nideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly \nprior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held \npreprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was \nseen by social work throughout admission.\n\n(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and \nconsistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout \nadmission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the \nbasis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with \nthe exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active \nbleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.\n\n(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect \nsynthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of \nmalignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-Patient discharge home with home hospice\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

Was managed with aggressive fluid \nresuscitation and pressor support in line with early goal \ndirected therapy. Source control with broad spectrum antibiotics \nas outlined below was instituted, tailoring antimicrobial \ncoverage to cultures accordingly and progressively discontinuing \nantibiotics as the patient stabilized in a step-wise fashion \nonce surveillance cultures were persistently negative. Once the \nseptic picture showed signs of resolving, the patient was \naggressively diuresed with Lasix GTT and transitioned to Lasix \nIV boluses; over the course of diuresis his respiratory function \nsteadily improved.\n.\n# Fever \/ leukocytosis \/ infectious source control: ID was \nconsulted on admission and followed throughout the \nhospitalization course. Was covered initially very broadly with \na combination of colistin\/aztreonam\/flagyl\/vancomycin \nPO\/daptomycin\/fluconazole, with daptomycin started in response \nto enterococcus species. Aztreonam\/amikacin\/colistin\/vancomycin \nPO were promptly discontinued and the patient was transitioned \nto amikacin, desensitized to cefepime and started started on \ncefepime. Amikacin was then discontinued and a regimen of \ndaptomycin\/cefepime\/metronidazole\/fluconazole was continued for \nabout 3 weeks until the patient began to stabilize and cultures \nwere negative at which point fluconazole was discontinued, \nfollowed by metronidazole, followed by daptomycin, and finally \ncefepime. Other than a gram negative species that grew out of \nthe left pseudocyst in late ___ and the entrococcus species \nalready mentioned, which was thought to likely be a contaminant \nby ID, all other cultures were negative, including cultures of \ncatheter tips and ascitic fluid. Leukocytosis showed a general \ntrend toward improvement with intermittent lability as did the \npatient's temperature; cultures taken at the time of spikes were \nrepeatedly negative. The etiology of the spikes remained unclear \nbut it was hypothesized that inflammatory mediators from a \nsterile cyst could be triggering febrile episodes; it could also \nnot be ruled out that the untapped midline cyst may be infected \nand transiently seeding the blood. Drug reaction, in particulary \nto cefepime and lasix was also considered.\n.\n# Pancreatic pseudocysts: ___ successfully placed a catheter in \nthe patient's lateral pseudocyst; culture data as above. Serial \nimaging showed some slight decrease in size in the cyst but no \nsignificant change. The midline cyst was not amenable to ___ \ndrainage; GI consult was obtained for endoscopic drainage, but \nintervention was deferred given the potential risks and \ncomplications in an otherwise critical patient. General surgery \nwas also consulted for the duration of the hospitalization; \nsurgery was deferred and the recommendation was made to continue \nthe drains until follow-up with outpatient General Surgery ___ \nweeks after discharge to rehab, but upon repeat CT imaging \nimmediately prior to discharge, the recommendation was made to \npull the lateral pancreatic cyst in light of it being smaller in \nsize and to continue the LLQ ascitic drain; the LLQ drain was \nsubsequently discontinued prior to discharge. The patient was \nscheduled for a repeat CT and follow-up with Dr. ___ in late \n___ prior to discharge; he was also scheduled for a \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ ___.\n\n#. Respiratory Failure \/ Tracheostomy: Intubated at an outside \nhospital for hypoxic respiratory failure. CMV\/AC was maintained \nand titrated to ABGs per the usual ICU protocol in conjunction \nwith appropriate IV sedation. Given the patient's anticipated \nprotracted ventilator dependence and difficult weaning course, \nthe decision was made to place a tracheostomy, which was \nperformed by thoracic surgery without complication circa ___, \nas dated by his thoracic surgery pre-op note. The cuff initially \nleaked intermittently, but after minor repositioning at the \nbedside functioned appropriately without further issues. The \npatient was progressively weaned to PS and ventilator mask as \ntolerated as his respiratory status improved in conjunction with \nhis overall clinical improvement as a result of the \ninterventions detailed above. Prior to discharge he was \nbreathing comfortably on trach mask 24 hours a day. He had an \nepisode of delerium late in his hospitalization the weekend \nprior to discharge which resulted in him pulling out his \ntracheostomy, but it was replaced without complication at the \nbedside and he subsequently had no further episodes. Speach and \nswallow consulted late in the hospitalization to fit a \nPassy-Muir valve, but was unsuccessful and it was thought that \nthis was due to the transient inflammation caused by the \naforementioned episode of removing and replacing his \ntracheostomy. Of note, he was phonating the day of discharge \nwithout the Passy-Muir valve. He will likely benefit from \ndownsizing of his cuff once in rehab.\n\n#. Left Sided Pleural Effusion: Noted early in the \nhospitalization that the patient had a left sided pleural \neffusion. This effusion was not tapped in the setting acute \ninstability and subsequently managed conservatively without \ntapping as the patient stabilized from a respiratory perspective \nwith the hypothesis that it would progressively shrink with \ndiuresis. The etiology was thought to be trans-diaphagramatic \nascites.\n\n# Anasarca \/ Volume overload: Iatrogoenic from fluid \nresuscitation and steadily improved with Lasix GTT followed by \nLasix Bolus IV which was then transitioned to PO in conjunction \nwith the patient's autodiuresis. Diuresis was titrated to remain \nwithin the patient's hemodynamic limits during the period of \nlabile hypotensive episodes and then titrated to Cr when the \npatient was more hemodynamically unstable. On discharge he was \nNEGATIVE 21 LITERS from admission and 96KG from 128KG on \nadmission. In the days prior to discharge, was transitioned from \nLasix to PO Torsemide, which was titrated to 30mg daily.\n\n# Ascites: Paracentesis fluid consistent with exudative process \nlikely due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Underwent paracentesis \nwith drain placement. The drain was discontinued prior to \ndischarge and the patient was scheduled for follow-up with Dr. \n___.\n\n# HYPO-tensive episodes, Labile blood pressures part 1 of 2: \nMultifactorial, initially due in large part to septic \nphysiology, but also complicated by a borderline \nabdominal-compartment syndrome in the setting of pancreatitis. \nHypotension was responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation and \nsource control in conjunction with pressors but SBP remained \nlabile into the ___ until the abdomen became less tense, \nwith peak bladder pressures ranging in the ___. Abdominal \ncompartment syndrome resolved with paracentesis and drain \nplacement as well as diuresis. In turn, hypotensive episodes \nalso resolved.\n\n# HYPER-tensive episodes, Labile blood pressures part 2 of 2: \nCoincident with hypotensive episodes, also had hypertensive \nepisodes especially in the setting of agitation. Agitation was \naddressed with IV sedatives in the early interval of the \nhospitalization and antipsychotics as detailed below in the \nlatter interval. Hypertensive medications were started and \ntitrated to address the hypertensive spikes - metoprolol and \nenalaprilat - in conjunction with prn labetalol and hydralazine. \nOnce the hypertensive episodes were less frequent and lower in \namplitude (peaking into the 190s at times), the patient was \ntransitioned onto a metoprolol 75 TID and enalaprilat was \ndiscontinued. Metoprolol was discontinued ___ because it was \nsuspected as a cause of his eosinophilia.\n\n# Sinus Tachycardia: Rate controlled with metoprolol as \ndescribed above, which was then discontinued because it was \nsuspected to be causing his eosinophilia. Metoprolol was \ndiscontinued and Diltiazem was started then titrated to 120 mg \nPO\/NG QID.\n\n# DM2 \/ Hyperglycemia: Blood sugars were controlled with an ISS \nand when running, TPN insulin to keep BS <150. Patient was \nstarted on a low dose of Glargine after TPN was dc'ed as blood \nsugars ran above 200 with the tube feeds. Glargine was titrated \nup to 45 U QHS prior to discharge.\n\n# Agitation\/Delirium: Once sedation was weaned, the patient had \nintermittent episodes of agitation and delerium, which were \ntreated with zyprexa 5 qAM & 10mg qPM and prn haldol. This \nregimen was discontinued late in the hospitalization because it \nwas thought to not be helping the patient's underlying problem, \nwhich was insomnia. Prior to discharge he was started on prn \n50mg Trazodone QHS, which was effective in inducing and \nmaintaining sleep.\n\n# Anemia of chronic disease: Iron studies were suggestive of \nACD; patient was transfused as needed to maintain Hct > 22.\n\n# Rash: Developed a diffuse macular rash over the extremities \nwith few weapy bullae at the peak of volume overload; \ndermatology was consulted and ruled out infectious processes; \nrash progressively improved with diuresis.\n\n# ___ \/ Hypernatremia due to low ECV: Normalized with IVF \nresuscitation.\n \n# Coagulopathy on admission due to malnutrition: Resolved with \nvitamin K; coag labs remained stable over the course of the \nhospitalization without signs suggestive of DIC.\n\n# Difficult Foley Change \/ Yeast UTI: One UC positive with yeast \nwith a corresponding bland UA.  He has a history of difficult \nfoley changes and during the hospitalization, foley exchange was \ndeferred despite the positive culture in the setting of diffuse \nanasarca and benefit of foley to daily aggressive diuresis. \nFoley was successfully changed ___ and subsequent UA showed 68 \nWBC with few bacteria and few yeast; he was asymptomatic. Foley \nwas subsequently discontinued; he was spontaneously voiding upon \ndischarge. Anti-fungals were not started under the premise that \nhe would likely clear the infection spontaneously.\n\n# s\/p NSTEMI on admission with dynamic EKG changes likely due to \ndemand ischemia. Maintained on ASA 300mg PR daily.\n\n# Diarrhea on admission: C.Dif negative x 2.\n\n# Eosinopilia: Had eosinophilia to 12% on ___. Was initially \nthought to be due to Cefepime, which he was desensitized to, as \nwell as Lasix; however, eosinophilia persisted after \ndiscontinuing these medications. Metoprolol was discontinued \nbecause it was thought to be a potential cause and eosinophilia \nsubsequently started to downtrend. It was thought that \nMetoprolol was the allergen and that Lasix was not. Eosinophilia \npersisted despite discontinuing Metoprolol; the cause remains \nunclear upon discharge.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nON TRANSFER:\n- Aztreonam 2g IV q8h\n- Daptomycin 600mg IV q24h\n- Flagyl 500mg IV q8h\n- Fentanyl 50-100mcg IV q2h prn pain\n- Fentanyl ___ IV gtt\n- Versed ___ IV q1h prn anxiety\n- Levophed ___ IV gtt\n- Vasopressin ___ units\/min IV gtt\n- Peridex mouthwash 15mL BID\n- Famotidine 20mg IV daily\n- Heparin 5000 units SC TID\n- Insulin gtt\n.\nHOME MEDS (from OSH admission note):\n- MVI daily\n- Prevacid 30mg PO daily\n- Symbicort 1puff BID\n- Pancrease enzymes 3capsules TID\n- Citalopram 20mg PO daily\n- Toprol XL 200mg daily\n- Lisinopril 5mg PO daily\n- Levemir 16 units qhs\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The patient's presentation on physical exam \nwas consistent with a superficial thrombophlebitis vs. early \ninfection at ___ site. She had no fevers and no apparent \ndischarge at site. Blood cultures were negative. Ultrasound of \nright upper extremity showed no abscesses and no evidence of any \nDVTs. The right PICC line was removed and a peripheral IV was \nplaced in order to continue her scheduled continuous infusion of \nCladribine therapy for her HCL. She was given some local warm \npacks, and percocet and then Tylenol for pain relief which she \ntolerated well. She had marked improvement by hospital day 2 \nwith less erythema, less tenderness and less edema at her prior \nright arm ___ site. Given negative screen for infectious causes \nand unremarkable ultrasound she was daignosed with a phlebitis \nreaction at ___ site that can be a common side effect of \nCladribine. Because she only had about ~50 hours of her therapy \nleft she remained inpatient for ongoing monitoring for an extra \nday until completing her full scheduled dose (25 mg remaining). \nAt time of discharge she had stable vital signs, and older ___ \nsite had only a small, well-healing bruise, otherwise much \nimproved from initial presentation. Erythema and tenderness had \nresolved.   \n.\n# Hairy Cell Leukemia: Patient initially presented to ED several \nweeks ago at the beginning of ___ with chief complaint of \nabdominal pain at left upper quadrant and noted to have massive \nsplenomegaly on CT. She also had thrombocytopenia so she was \nreferred for hematology\/oncology follow-up, and she is now being \nfollowed closely by Dr. ___. On this admission she was \nfinishing up her planned Cladribine therapy. During her hospital \nstay she tolerated infusion very well with some occasional \nnausea which was treated with compazine initially and then some \nadditional Zofran with good effects. No associated emesis, \ndiarrhea or abdominal pains. On physical exam, enlarged spleen \nthat was mildly tender to palpation. . She was set-up for a \nfollow-up outpatient oncology appointment for about 1 week after \nher discharge. She was discharged with instructions to begin her \nprophylactic doses of Acyclovir and Bactrim DS.  Of note, she \nwas already vaccinated on ___ for pneumococcus, \nmeningococcus,and hemophilus influenza. \n.  \n#)Chest pain: Ms. ___ complained of some vague chest \ntightness upon arrival to the ED. The cause of the patient's \nchest pain was unclear per ED staff. Cardiac enzymes were \nnegative and EKG showed no ischemic changes, normal axis and \nnoraml rate and intervals. Symptoms were ___ severity and \nhighly atypical for acute coronary syndrome. CTA scan results \nruled her out for any pulmonary embolus. By the time she arrived \non ___ floor she was asymptomatic and had no further complaints \nthroughout her stay. Per patient, she endorsed that she felt her \nchest pains may have been stress and anxiety related as she had \nfelt very concerned about a possible line infection upon arrival \nto ED. Will continue to monitor symptoms without further \nintervention at this time.  \n.  \n#)Prophylaxis: The patient was not given any additional \nantocoagulation given her thrombocytopenia history. She was \nencouraged to ambulation BID-TID.   \n.  \n#)Code Status: The patient was maintained as a full code status \nfor the entirety of her hospital course.   \n.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPercocet prn  \nLorazepam 0.5mg tid prn  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. Acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a \nday.  \n2. Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO every six (6) hours \nas needed for sleep,anxiety, nausea.  \n3. Compazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) \nhours as needed for nausea.  \n4. Bactrim DS 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO 3X WEEK: \nPLEASE TAKE ONE TABLET EVERY ___. .  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary: \n-Superficial Thrombophlebitis of right forearm\n-Hairy Cell Leukemia\n.\nSecondary:\n- History of diabetes mellitus, diet controlled   \n- Anxiety\n.\nOther past medical history:\n- status post knee and ankle surgeries x 3  \n- status post appendectomy  \n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nGood. At time of discharge the patient had stable vital signs \nand she was in no apparent distress.","summary":"You were admitted with redness, irritation, local tenderness and swelling at the ___ IV line site in your right arm. An ultrasound was done to ensure you did not have any blood clots or abscesses. The PICC line was removed and the area seemed to recover well over a period of 2 days. Because you only had 2 days left for the rest of your cladribine infusion the ___ team decided to monitor your right arm and continue the rest of your therapy as an inpatient through a new peripheral IV line. After you completed your therapy this line was removed. Ultimately, it was felt that you did not have a skin infection and you were diagnosed with a condition called thrombophlebitis which is a local irritation of the blood vessels. This is a common side effect of cladribine therapy."}

No evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension, \nand EGD in ___ was unremarkable. Patient underwent EGD on ___ \nwhich was unrevealing for source of bleed. She underwent \ncolonscopy which was also negative. Capusle study only revealed \nsmall ileal angioectasia but no active bleeding. The patient \nremained hemodynamically stable without further epsidodes of \nacute bleeding. H\/H stable at 8.3\/25.4 on discharge. As \ndescribed, anticoagulation was started in setting of APLS after \ndiscussion of risks and benefits. Discharge per GI recs on PPI \ndaily.\n\n#History of PE, APLAS: Home warfarin was held given active GI \nbleed. The patient carries this diagnosis in the medical record \nand appears to have been diagnosed in the 1990s with unclear \ncriteria. Her family history is notable for a sister with a \ndiagnosis of APLS and strong family history of connective tissue \ndisease. However given concern for anticoagulation in the \nsetting of GI bleed of unclear source with a supratherapeutic \nINR,  hematology was consulted. Repeat anti cardiolipin, anti \nbeta 2 glycoprotein and lupus anticoagulant antibodies were \nsent.  However despite no clear historical data to prove this \ndiagnosis, the patient felt strongly that she would like to \nremain on anticoagulation. She was started on hep gtt after \ncolonoscopy without evidence of bleeding. In depth discussion \nwas held with the patient regarding risks of anticoagulation in \nthe setting of the GI bleed, as well as the benefits to prevent \npossible renal TMA and or DVT\/PE from APLS. Ultimately, after \nthis discussion, the patient elected to be discharged on \nwarfarin without a bridge, with plans for close outpatient \nfollow up with hematology and primary care for further \nmanagement and follow up of APLS.\n\n# ESRD s\/p LRRT complicated by CKD, likely secondary to diabetic \nnephropathy: Cr at baseline on admission (1.5), although likely \nhypovolemic in setting of GI bleed. Continued on tacrolimus, \nMMF, and prednisone for immunosuppression and home calcitriol \nfor prednisone ppx (home Bactrim was recently discontinued prior \nto admission and may be resumed at the discretion of outpatient \nproviders). Tacrolimus decreased to 1 mg Q12 H from 2 mg on \nadmission. \n\n#DM1 c\/b gastroparesis, neuropathy: last Hgb A1C 9.3%. On home \nglargine 36 u QAM\/ 22 u QPM and Humalog sliding scale. She was \ncontinued on home promethazine for gastroparesis and home \ngabapentin, duloxetine, and lidocaine patches fr diabetic \nneuropathy. \n\n# Positive UA: Patient with evidence of pyuria and urinary \nfrequency though UCx growing urogenital flora. Antibiotics were \nheld pending repeat urine culture, which will be followed after \ndischarge by Dr. ___.\n\n# HTN: Initially home anti hypertensives held in setting of GI \nBleed but these were restarted prior to discharge. \n\n# CAD s\/p MI with DES ___: Patient continued on home Plavix, \naspirin, atorvastatin and ranolazine.\n\n# PAD: Patient continued on cilostazol.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued on home levothyroxine\n\n# Gout: Patient continued on home allopurinol. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n========================\n[ ] Please ensure transplant labs drawn 1 week post discharge\n[ ] Patient to have UCx followed by Dr. ___ as outpatient \n[ ] Ensure follow up with hematology for further evaluation and \nmanagement of APLS\n[ ] Ensure follow up with nephrology as an outpatient \n[ ] Continue to monitor closely for evidence of bleeding as \npatient on warfarin, aspirin and Plavix\n\n# Communication: HCP: sister ___ ___  \n# Code: Full confirmed  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She remained intubated for most of \nher MICU stay due to pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle \nweakness with a poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Her NIF \ngradually improved with optimization of her nutrition and \nsupportive care. Her pulmonary edema was addressed with \naggressive diuresis with IV and PO Lasix boluses (responds well \nto Lasix 10mg IV). With treatment of these issues, she was able \nto be successfully extubated to nasal cannula on ___. She \nwas started on Lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction ___ \nsetting of her 2+ MR which may have been causing the pulmonary \nedema. She may require further PRN doses of Lasix at rehab; if \nso would try Lasix 20mg PO PRN. Consider increasing lisinopril \nto 10mg for better afterload reduction pressure tolerating.\n.\n# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to \neverything but Gentamicin on ___ urine culture. She was \ninitially started on double coverage with Cipro\/Cefepime while \ncultures pending, then narrowed to Cefepime alone, then \nbroadened to Meropenam per ID recs.

She completed Zosyn course on ___, received total of 10 \ndays antibiotics for complicated UTI. \n.\n# RASH: pt noted to have red macular rash on extremities after \nstarting meropenam, initially presumed to be meropenam drug rash \nso meropenam was stopped. However this was later believed to be \nmore consistent with contact dermatitis vs. eczema. \nTriamcinolone cream was started and rash improved. \n.\n# C Diff Colitis: Patient was recently admitted for C. diff \ncolitis with sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during last \nhospitalization. She completed her PO vancomycin course on \n___. Her PO vancomycin was continued during hospitalization \nbecause of concurrent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics \n(zosyn) for pseudomonas UTI. Her zosyn was completed on ___, \nshould continued PO vanco until ___. \n.\n# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools during last \nadmission, new from past admission. Hct stable ___ high ___ \nthroughout hospitalization; she did receive one unit pRBC for \ncolloid pressure support.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.\n.\n# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, \nwhich was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was \ntransitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis which was held ___ \nsetting of delirium. Famotidine was restarted at 20mg BID once \nshe was no longer delirious. \n\n# EKG Changes: Patient had lateral STE and mildly elevated \ntroponin x3 (CK\/MB flat)on admission, felt likely due to blunt \ninjury ___ compressions ___ ED vs. demand ischemia. \n.\n# A-line: patient had femoral A-line placed ___ ED ___ setting of \nher hypotension. This was discontinued ___ ICU and replaced with \nPICC. She had one set of BCx which grew Lactobacillus, likely \nskin contaminant.

TRACING #1\n\nMICROBIOLOGY:\n___ MRSA Screen - No MRSA isolated.\n___ Blood Cx x2 - Pending\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with a longstanding history of GERD\/gastritis, ___, \nHTN recent esophageal manometry this ___ showing occasional \nesophageal dysmotility in 20% of the esophagus who presented \nwith dysphagia of solids and was found to have several impaired \nelectrolyte levels.  \n\n# Dysphagia: The patient has a long-standing history of GERD, \n___ esophagus, and recent diagnosis of 20% esophageal \ndysmotility on manometry.  She was referred to ___ by her \noutpatient GI doctor, ___ expedited workup of her \ndysphagia for solids (good liquid intake).   Nutrition saw and \nnoted patient was able to tolerate supplements.  The GI consult \nteam saw the patient and recommended a barium swallow study that \nshowed mild esophageal dysmotility and mild reflux. She also \nunderwent a video swallow that revealed no upper esophageal \nsphincter dysfunction despite very mild narrowing at the \nsphincter, felt highly unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms. \nA zinc level was sent to assess zinc deficiency as a source of \nher dysphagia - this was pending at the time of discharge.  The \npatient was started on diltiazem for her esophageal spasms. Of \nnote, atenolol and amlodipine were held, and simvastatin was \nswitched to atorvastatin given the interaction between \nsimvastatin and diltiazem. At the time of discharge, the patient \nwas able to tolerate soft solids and liquids.  She was scheduled \n___ with her outpatient gastroenterologist and PCP to \nassess effect of diltiazem and\/or restart prior antihypertensive \nmedications.\n\n# Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has has chronic \nhyponatremia per report and records but was found on \npresentation to have hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, \nand hypophosphatemia in the setting of decreased PO intake for 1 \nmonth.  Given her elevated lactate on admission that decreased \nin response to fluids, the etiology was thought most likely due \npoor PO intake.  It was also felt that the patient's furosemide \ncontributed and\/or precipitated her current electrolyte \nabnormalities and her prior admission in ___. The patient \nwas advised not take lasix but the patient was insistent upon \nrestarting her lasix.  In total, the patient received 10 L of \nfluid in the ___ ED and MICU as well as electrolyte \nsupplementation with significant improvement in electrolytes. \nMonitoring included EKG that was without U-waves or ischemic \nchanges. She was transferred to the medical floor, where \nelectrolyte supplementation and maintenance IV fluids were \ncontinued.  At the time of discharge, the patient's electrolytes \nwere all within normal limits except for a slightly low calcium \nlevel (8.1).  The patient was scheduled for PCP ___ with \nelectrolyte check a week after discharge.\n\n# Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension to sBP ___ \nthought most likely due hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO \nintake due to dysphagia. She remained without signs of shock, \nbleeding, or infection.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# History bowel obstruction: The patient was monitored and \ncontinued to pass both gas and stool during this admission.\n\n# HLD: The patient's home simvastatin 20mg was converted to \natorvastatin 20mg daily when diltiazem was started, given \nconcern of rhabdomyolysis from simvastatin and diltiazem in \ncombination.\n\n# Insomnia: The patient was continued on her home trazadone 50mg \nwithout complications.\n\n# ___ swelling: The patient takes furosemide at home. Given that \nthis like contributed or preipitated her electrolyte \nabnormalities, the patient was encouarged to stop furosemide.  \nHowever, he felt adamant about resuming this.  She will need an \nelectrolyte check at her PCP appointment on ___.\n\n===========================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===========================\nMEDICATION CHANGES\n- Diltiazem 30mg QID was STARTED for esophageal spasms\n- Atenolol was STOPPED because diltiazem was started\n- Amlodipine was STOPPED because diltiazem was started\n- Simvastatin was STOPPEd because it interacts with diltiazem, \nand atorvastatin was STARTED instead. \n- If her diltiazem is not helping her symptoms, it would be \nreasonable to restart her home antihypertensive regimen.\n- Patient was cautioned to stop the diltiazem if she experiences \ndizziness or lightheadedness. \n- The patient was encouraged to STOP her Lasix given concern \nthat it is source of her electrolyte abnormalities, but she was \nadamant about continuing this medication. She will likely \ncontinue despite our strong warning against it. \n\nOTHER ISSUES\n- Patient has a pending Zinc level. Low zinc can also cause many \nelectrolyte disturbances consistent with her picture, so she \nshould be repleted if this level is low and worked up for causes \nof low zinc (possibly simple low dietary intake given her eating \nissues). \n- The patient remained Full Code during this hospitalization\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Mr. ___ had been declining PRN pain \nmedication. Discussion with patient to help him better \nunderstand current physical state and that it is okay to need \npain medications right now. He agreed that would have a better \nquality of life if we control his pain presently.\nPatient was seen by ortho ___, MD, who \nrecommended use of TLSO brace with activity. This alleviated a \ndegree of his pain. \n\nPatient course was complicated by constipation most likely \nsecondary to both inability to get to bathroom prn as well as \npain when defecating limiting effort. In turn constipation \ncontributed to lower back pain. With PRN use of pain medication \nand support brace his pain was controlled to degree patient \nwilling to tolerate sedentary side effects of opiates. \n\n#Febrile Neutropenia: \nFirst spiked fevers ___ as high as 102.7. Subsequently \ndeveloped Neutropenia. Admission ___: 1300; Nadir ANC 510 \n(___). Unclear etiology. Initiation of Velcade and \nDexamethasone scheduled for ___ were held at this time. No \nobvious precipitating factor. Started on Cefepime for febrile \nneutropenia. \n\n Results of recent marrow tap not finalized, however per \nconversation with primary oncology team some samples showing \nrange of 40-90% plasma cell predominance. Patient w\/MM puts at \nrisk for infection given functional hypogammaglobulinemia. Bone \nmarrow crowding is possible, however is now s\/p two doses of \nbortezomib which usually has a more rapid marrow response. \nPossible other etiologies include viral etiology such as CMV and \nEBV as patient has concordant transaminitis. No other known \nrecent sick contacts prior to hospitalization. Did not at \npresent have any localizing symptoms. TLS not common in MM. CXR \nat time of fever w\/o evidence of consolidation however cannot \nrule out pneumonia and not aspiration risk or concern for \npneumonitis. No abdominal pain or diarrhea suggestive of noro or \nc diff. Had one large formed BM yesterday to great relief. No \nrecent proceduralization. \n\n Fevers broke ___. All infectious studies and imaging to date \nof discharge negative. Given transaminitis specific viral \netiologies considered EBV, CMV. Also negative. RUQUS revealed no \nconcerning biliary or hepatic pathology. ANC at d\/c: ~1000. Plan \nwas to continue empiric course of 7 days levofloxacin until \ncompletion.\n\n# Constipation\nHad sparse use of pain medications at home PTA. No use of \nopioids. Had been having intermittent BM. Since admission and \nuse of opioids has not had significant BM. Abdominal exam is \nsoft, but full. Pain has limited ability to physically make it \nto toilet initially. Since initation of brace has felt he cannot \nvalsalva well, however pain has limited effort as well. \n\nDiscussed need to continue to use opioids despite their \ncontribution to constipation as they will enable ability to \npush. Trial with polyethylene glycol did not produce BMs. \nResponded immediately with sips of ___ Mag Citrate:Ginger Ale. \n\n# Transaminitis\nNoted elevation of LFTs ___ ALT: 108 AST: 71 now ___: ALT: 362 \nAST: 356. Alk phos and TBili wnl and unchanged during this time \nperiod. INR stably 1.2. \n\n Likely ___ medication side effect from acetaminophen \nresponsible for uptrending transaminiases. Responded to d\/c of \nacetominophen. No other current medications w\/known \nhepatotoxicity. Bortezomib not typically associated with liver \ntoxicity. No other recent illness or localizing symptoms. \nPossible viral etiologies include: hepatidities, CMV, EBV, HIV. \nNo hx hiv, no current clinical suspicion for hiv. All other \nstudies negative to date at time of d\/c. Recomment vaccination \nas above. \n\n# Multiple Myeloma: \n IgG Multiple Myeloma diagnosed last week in the workup of \nnon-traumatic T-spine fracture.

Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given \nviscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a \nregular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care \nwith both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative \ncare team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not \npursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary \nsymptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to \nstrictures and radiation esophagitis. \n\n#Failure to thrive\nSeems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be \ndue to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). \nShe has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e\/o pulmonary infection. UA neg \nat OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved \nin the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body \npain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous \nlidocaine to help her eat\/drink more comfortably. She was \nsupported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and \nrecommended rehab placement however after long discussions of \nher GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding \nand would like to go home on hospice. \n\n#Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ\nIn the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. \nHAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for \nmajor bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The \ndefinitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment \nof her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA\/Plavix were \ncontinued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, \nwith the plan to treat for 1 month.\n\n#Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma\n#Bilateral lytic scapular lesions\nMost recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial \ndecrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now \nmeasures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed \"new \n1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for \nmetastasis.\" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver \ninvolvement.

Clinical \ncorrelation is suggested.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y\/o F with a h\/o ___ esophagus, chronic dysphagia and \nnausea, anemia, COPD, and Takotsubo's (___), who presents \nfor evaluation of presyncope.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n# Presyncope: BP upon arrival was 97\/67 with tachycardia \nconsistently over 100. Patient has a history of similar symptoms \nand has presented to ___ several times and treated with IV \nfluids. Given chronic nausea\/dysphagia, presyncope was \nattributed to orthostasis in the setting of poor PO intake. \nPatient had two EKGs during admission, which showed no evidence \nof ischemia or arrythmia that would explain her symptoms. She \nreceived a total of 3.5L NS IVF during her stay with improvement \nin her SBPs to 110-130's with HR 90's on day of discharge. She \nalso had normal orthostatic vital signs and was able to ambulate \nwithout any residual dizziness. Nutrition was consulted given \npatient's history of poor PO intake and recommended continuing \nto encourage PO and supplementing with a multivitamin w\/ \nminerals. \n\n#  Nausea, Dysphagia, ___: She has a history of chronic \nnausea and dysphagia for the last several years and has \nundergone an extensive workup as an outpatient. EGD in ___ \nconfirmed ___ esophagus. She also has had barium swallow, \nesophageal manometry, gastric emptying studies in ___ \nwithout significant positive results. It is likely that anxiety \nmay also be contributing to symptoms, particularly her \nanticipatory nausea, including nausea upon smelling foods. She \nhad a recent CT abdomen, which showed an elevated right \nhemidiaphragm with insinuation of the colonic hepatic flexure \nbetween the liver and hemidiaphragm (Chilaiditi sign). Based on \nthese results, she was evaluated by the Bariatric Surgery team \nwhile inpatient, Per surgery, although eventually a Diagnostic \nLaparoscopy to look for an adhesion\/kink could be considered, \nthey would first recommend colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. Due \nto the timing and chronicity of her symptoms, these would best \nbe pursued as an outpatient. She remained nauseous throughout \nher admission and was given IV Zofran ___ PRN, with PO Ativan \n0.25mg once for nausea unresponsive to Zofran. She was also \ncontinued on her home omeprazole. She was discharged on PO \nZofran for her continued nausea.\n\n# SIADH: Patient had Na 131 on admission, which downtrended to \n128 day prior to discharge. Urine electrolytes were sent and \nwere notable for urine osm 404 and urine Na 167. High urine osm \nin the setting of low sodium avidity was attributed to SIADH. \nPer chart review, patient does have history of SIADH. Based on \nthese results, her worsening hyponatremia was attributed to IV \nfluid boluses for poor PO intake.\n\n# UTI: She has a history of recent UTI with pansensitive E Coli. \nA UA on admission was notable for pyuria though urine culture \nwas negative. She was given one dose of cefpodoxime in the ED. \nUpon admission she was continued on her previously prescribed \nMacrobid dose and completed the last 3 days of her scheduled \ncourse during her stay. On day of discharge, she continued to \ncomplain of a \"heavy feeling\" with urination though was \notherwise asymptomatic.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n# Normocytic anemia: Patient's Hgb as low as 8's during her \nstay, most likely due to dilutional effect of IVF boluses. \nAnemia could potentially have further contributed to her \nsymptoms of dizziness\/lightheadedness. The etiology of her \nchronic anemia is unclear, though past workup has suggested \nmixed iron deficiency\/anemia of chronic disease. Ferritin was \nchecked during her stay, which was normal and would be \nconsistent with a mixed cause of anemia. She should get a \ncolonoscopy as an outpatient based on possible iron deficiency \nand length of time since last colonoscopy in ___.\n\n# Constipation: She has a history of chronic constipation with \nBMs q2-3 days at home. Constipation is most likely due to \nmedications (oxycodone, oxybutynin, zofran) and poor PO intake. \nShe was continued on her home colace and started on senna, \nmiralax, and milk of magnesia with improvement.\n\n# Bladder Spasm: She was continued on her home dose of \noxybutynin. \n\n# COPD: She is a former smoker and has a history of COPD with \nhome oxygen requirement of 2 liters. She takes Anoro as an \noutpatient. She is seen by Dr. ___ at ___. Last PFT's \nnotable for DLCO 39%. She was given 2L O2 via nasal canula \nduring her stay. Anoro was held while inpatient because it is \nnon-formulary, and albuterol nebs were ordered as needed but not \nrequired.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n- Per surgery, would first recommend EGD and Colonoscopy to \nfurther work-up her nausea prior to other interventions, but \ncould consider a Diagnostic Laparoscopy in the long term. She \nhas also had a previous gastric emptying study which was read as \nfast transit. She has seen an gastroenterologist in the past but \nwould prefer to be referred to a new one.\n- Nutrition: A multivitamin w\/ minerals was added this \nadmission. Recommend to trend weights at home 3 times per week, \nand to eat small and frequent meals.\n- She takes Lasix as needed for leg swelling, this was held \nduring this admission due to low BP and dehydration on \nadmission.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg\/actuation inhalation Q6H:PRN SOB \n2.

This happened because you were dehydrated, likely due to not being able to take enough food by mouth. You were given fluids in your IV, which helped your blood pressure return to normal. You have been having problems with nausea for a long time. While you were here, the surgery team saw you and looked at your CT scan. They do not think that there is any surgery that should be done right now to fix your nausea, but that it will be very important to get a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy done as an outpatient to complete the workup for your nausea. You have had low sodium levels for a long time as well. This is because of something called SIADH, or Syndrome of Antidiuretic Hormone, that causes you to retain extra water and lose fluid."}

Patient's exam \ngenerally unremarkable, with normal blood pressures and good \nmentation. Labs notable for a negative troponin and EKG without \nacute changes. Hospital course complicated by hyponatremia, \nhyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n\n#Chest pain\n#Pericarditis\nHis chest pain on presentation was very similar to his most \nrecent presentation of pericarditis. In the absence of troponin \nelevation and EKG changes, this was likely a recurrent \npericarditis flare. No evidence of recurrent pericardial \neffusion on TTE ___. He was recently discharged on a \nprednisone taper and taking 10 mg daily prior to admission. The \npatient received prednisone 40 mg in the emergency room on ___ \nwith plan to continue prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days followed \nby a slower steroid taper. Pantoprazole was continued for GI \nprophylaxis. Given persistently recurring chest pain and \ninability to give NSAIDs in the setting of CAD status post PCI \n___, aspirin was increased to 320 mg daily for 2 weeks with \nplan for subsequent decrease back to 81 mg daily (the patient \nmay continue taking 320 mg daily for pain as needed). Colchicine \ntwice daily was continued. Chest pain resolved within 1 day of \nadmission. Follow up with cardiology is recommended.\n\n#Hyponatremia\nThe patient presented with hypoosmolar hyponatremia to 120 which \nwas asymptomatic (exacerbated by initial blood glucose of 220. \nUrine lytes were notable for Na of 43. Given euvolemia on exam \nhis hyponatremia was most likely secondary to SIADH in the \nsetting of acute pain from pericarditis. A.m. cortisol level low \nin the setting of current treatment with prednisone as above. \nTSH not significantly elevated. Patient was placed on fluid \nrestriction of 1.5 L daily and his sodium subsequently increased \nto 128. The patient was educated to continue with the daily \nfluid restriction until he follows up with his primary care \nphysician. Follow up within ___ weeks is recommended to ensure \nnormalization of hyponatremia.\n-Discharge serum sodium: 128\n\n#Hyperkalemia\nThe patient's potassium during his hospital stay was increased \nto 5.7, asymptomatic. Etiology remains unclear, hyperlipidemia \nas below possibly contributing. No evidence of acute kidney \ninjury. Potassium normalized to his baseline with treatment of \nhypoglycemia as below.\n-Discharge serum potassium: 4.5\n\n#Type II diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent\n#Hyperlipidemia\nPatient was initially continued on his home insulin regimen with \n75 units of glargine twice daily plus an insulin sliding scale. \nHowever, his blood sugars are persistently elevated to 260-360 \nwith the increased prednisone dose. ___ was consulted to \nassist with further management recommended an increase of his \ninsulin sliding scale. His glargine was changed to 75 qAM and \n30qHS (due to hypoglycemia) with sliding scale with meals.

Prominent ventricles and sulci are \nsuggestive of \nage-related involutional change.  Diffuse periventricular, \nsubcortical and deep white matter hypodensity is compatible with \nchronic small vessel ischemic disease.  The basal cisterns are \npatent and there is preservation of gray-white matter \ndifferentiation.  No fracture is identified.  Mucosal wall \nthickening is noted in the left frontal sinus.  The remainder of \nthe paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities \nare clear.  Globes are intact. IMPRESSION:  No acute \nintracranial abnormality. \n\nCT NECK ___\nFINDINGS: \nThe osseous structures are grossly demineralized.  No fracture \nor malalignment is identified.  The prevertebral soft tissues \nare unremarkable.  There are multilevel multifactorial \ndegenerative changes of the cervical spine with prominent \nanterior and posterior osteophytes particularly at the level of \nC5\/C6 which mildly indents the ventral thecal sac.  Multilevel \ndisc space narrowing is most severe at the C5\/C6.  Multilevel \nfacet joint and uncovertebral hypertrophic changes mildly narrow \nthe neural foramina. A calcification is again noted in the right \nthyroid lobe.  The thyroid is otherwise unremarkable.  The \ntrachea is midline.  The imaged lung apices are clear.  \nLeft-sided pacer leads are partially imaged. IMPRESSION: No \nacute fracture or malalignment. \n\nCXR ___\nFINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. \n Triple lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads \nsimilar in position.  There is elevation of the left \nhemidiaphragm and slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle \nwhich may be due to a small pleural effusion with overlying \natelectasis.  Calcifications project over the left mid lung.  No \nright pleural Effusion is seen.  The right lung is clear. \nIMPRESSION:  Left base opacity may be due to combination of \npleural effusion And atelectasis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old gentleman with history of systolic HF\/CAD with AICD, \nafib on warfarin, presenting with an episode of \nweakness\/pre-syncope and supratherapeutic INR.\n\n*** Active Diagnoses ***\n\n# Weakness\/Pre-Syncope: Atraumatic fall with no evidence of \nbleed or fracture on CT head or spine. Given history of \ndiarrhea, vomiting while on the floor, mild ___ (baseline Cr of \n1.0), and new furosemide therapy, orthostatic hypotension was \nconsidered on presentation.  The patient was noted to be \northostatic on admission. IV fluids were given judiciously \nbecause of his history of severe HF with depressed EF ___, \nlast echo ___.  No evidence of arrhythmia on ICD interrogation \nby EP. No evidence of acute MI with unremarkable trops x2 and \nECG at baseline. The patient was monitored on tele with no \nevents. Digoxin level 0.8 ng\/mL. Furosemide, spironolactone and \nlisinopril were initially held and restarted at discharge. His \ndose of furosemide was decreased to 10mg daily. The patient most \nlikely experienced hypovolemia from decreased PO intake leading \nto hypovolemia and his weakness\/pre-syncope. Pt  sent to \n___ rehabilitation per ___.\n\n# Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on warfarin for his h\/o \na.fib. Warfarin was initially held. He received got 10mg PO \nvitamin K in the ED . He normally is on 1mg of warfarin daily. \nThe patient reports notes no change in dosing or diet recently. \nDiarrhea and decreased PO intake likely lead to his \nsupratherpeutic INR. The patient was restarted on warfarin on \n___ with plan to re-check his INR upon discharge.\n\n*** Chronic Diagnoses ***\n\n# Chronic systolic heart failure s\/p ICD placement: Baseline EF \n30%-35%, last echo ___. The patient has an ICD. The patient's \nspironolactone, lisinopril and furosemide were initially held \ndue to orthostasis, but subsequently restarted. Metoprolol and \ndigoxin were continued. Digoxin level on admission 0.8. The \npatient has cardiology follow up scheduled.\n\n# Coronary artery disease: S\/p CABG in 1990s. Denied any chest \npain. EKG unremarkable for acute ST \/T wave changes. Trop 0.03 \nand 0.04. The patient was continued on aspirin 81mg daily and \nmetoprolol XL 50mg daily. Lisinopril was restarted at discharge \nafter discontinuation in the setting of orthostatic hypotension.\n\n# A fib\/A flutter: Telemetry showed sequential AP-VP. No episode \nof RVR. The patient was continued on metoprolol, digoxin and \namiodarone. INR was initially supratherapeutic at 9.0. Corrected \nwith 10mg PO vitamin K. Warfarin was restarted at 1mg per day on \n___.\n\n# Hypertension: Orthostatic on admission. BP medications were \nheld, and subsequently restarted.\n\n# Pleural effusion vs atelectasis on CXR: Not impressive. Shows \npossibly elevated right hemidiaphragm which appears irregular, \nconsistent with either atelectasis or pleural effusion, but does \nnot appear significantly changed from before. He has no history \nof malignancy, no evidence of PE currently, does note that he \nmay have had pneumonia a few months prior, but unlikely to be \ncomplicated parapneumonic effusion. \n \n# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. The patient was continued on \natorvastatin 40mg daily. \n\n# Depression: Stable. The patient was continued on sertraline \n25mg daily.  \n\n# Incidental finding of thyroid calcifications: \"A  \ncalcification  is  noted  in  the  right  thyroid  lobe.

Subsequently, the patient was \nfound to have positive blood cultures growing MSSA.  He was \ninitially start on vancomycin, which was then transitioned to \ndaptomycin given his changing renal function.  He underwent a \nTTE, followed by a TEE which were both negative for \nendocarditis.  His last positive bacterial blood culture was \nfrom ___.  He is to have weekly safety labs including CK \nwhile he is receiving daptomycin.  Given his osteomyelitis and \nepidural abscess (see below) he is to remain on daptomycin for 6 \nweeks following his last foot wash out (___).  Daptomycin 760 \nmg IV Q48H x6 weeks ___\nto finish on ___ unless otherwise specified by outpatient \nInfectious Disease follow up.\n.\n# Fungemia (C albicans)\nThe patient was noted to be growing ___ albicans from a \nblood culture dated ___.  He was started on micafungin and \nsurveillance fungal blood cultures were sent and subsequently \nreturned negative.  An ophthalmic evaluation did not reveal \nevidence of fungal endophthalmitis.  He was transitioned to \nfluconazole po, which he is to take for a total of a 2 week \ncourse starting from the date of his first negative blood \nculture; completing on ___.\n\n# C7 Epidural abscess\nIn the evening of ___, patient reported that his LUE felt weak. \n On exam, he was noted to have significant weakness with \nextension of his LUE, including triceps, wrist and fingers.  An \nMR of the Cspine was concerning for an epidural abscess at C7.  \nHe was taken to the OR on ___ for C5-T1 laminectomy and \nepidural abscess drainage and he tolerated the procedure well.  \nThe abscess fluid that was drained also grew MSSA.  His \nanticoagulation was transiently held (48 hours) while the \nsurgical drain was in place.  The drain was d\/c without \nincident.  The patient denied subsequent neck pain and his LUE \nweakness slowly began to improve. He continues to have \ndifficulties with left finger (digit ___ extension and weakness \nparticuarly with tricep extension.  Flexion of the LUE and grip \nstrength remain relatively preserved.  Orthopedics will follow \nup patient as an outpatient though appointments have not been \nscheduled yet. Orthopedics contacted morning of discharge and \nwill schedule an outpatient appointment.\n.\n# Osteomyelitis\nAfter the patient's bedside aspiration by podatry, he was taken \nto the OR for an I&D and bone biopsy.  The patient's bone biopsy \nbegan growing MSSA as well and the pathology was consistent with \nacute osteomyelitis.  The patient went for subsequent wash out \nof the wound, and cultures continued to grow MSSA.  As above, he \nis to continue on daptomycin for at least six weeks following \nhis last foot wash out, last dose is to be ___ unless \notherwise directed.  He is to remain non-weight bearing on his \nleft lower extremity until follow up appointment by podiatry. \nAgain, Podiatry is scheduling appointment though follow up visit \nhas not been made by discharge time.

No microorganisms were noted on gram stain \nand the initial fluid culture was negative.  The patient \nunderwent a subsequent aspiration of a fluid collection on the \nlateral aspect of his left foot by podiatry, which revealed MSSA \nin additional to multiple monosodium urate crystals.  He had \nbeen started on prednisone by his PCP even prior to admission.  \nThis was continued as an inpatient and tapered down given his \nconcurrent infection and as his pain improved.  His last dose of \nprednisone is to be ___.  He was not started on uric acid \nlowering therapy during this admission as he was in an acute \nflair of his gout.  He is to follow up with rheumatology in 4 \nweeks.\n  \n# Anemia: Chronically anemic likely related to anemia of chronic \ndisease and chronic kidney disease causing poor EPO production. \nOn day of discharge his Hct level was 22.5.

Because the patient was subtherapeutic, a PE was \nthought to be a possibility given her hx of PE along with her \nantiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A V\/Q scan however, was \nnegative for PE. Given the patient's worsening chest pain \npossibly c\/w angina along with her multiple strong risk factors \nwith a TIMI score of ___, the patient underwent a diagnostic \ncatheterization (with pre-cath hydration with mucomyst\/bicarb to \nprotect her transplanted kidney). The catheterization revealed 1 \nvessel CAD with diffuse disease of the distal LAD and a D1 \nlesion of 80%, which was revascularized with balloon angioplasty \nbut not stented. Because there was some difficulty engaging the \ncatheter into the vessel above the inguinal ligament and because \nthe patient was on heparin, there was concern for a \nretroperitoneal bleed. A CT scan was ordered which was negative \nfor a retroperitoneal bleed and her Hct remained stable. The \npatient's INR was subtherapeutic because the coumadin was \nstopped due to the catheterization. The patient was discharged \nhome on Lovenox as a bridge to her coumadin titration to \ntherapeutic levels. Pertinent labs include the following: AMI \npanel negative x 3, Cr of 1.0 on ___, Hct of 32.3, platelets \n304.  On the day of discharge the patient remained chest pain \nfree for > 72 hours and felt great.\n\nThe transplant service followed the patient throughout the \nadmission.  No medication changes were made to her \nimmunosuppressive regimen.  ___ post discharge, she will need \na full set of transplant labs, and an INR check.

No focal \nconsolidation or pneumothoraces are seen. \n- CT abomen & pelvis without contrast ___: No evidence of \nmalignancy in the abdomen or pelvis \n- CT chest with contrast ___: Slight interval increase in size \nof the enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes of unknown etiology. \nUnchanged sclerotic T11 vertebral body, which is nonspecific, \nand could be from prior trauma. \n- CXR ___: Heart size  unchanged. Stable pulmonary edema. \nSubsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases is also seen.  There \nis no definite \nconsolidation. No pneumothoraces are seen. \n- Transthoracic echocardiogram ___: Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic \nsystolic function. Mild resting apical gradient and moderate \nresting LVOT gradient (peak gradient 63mmHg). Moderate pulmonary \nhypertension.\n- CXR ___: Similar to the previous study, with bilateral pleural \neffusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases \n- Cardiac MR ___: No CMR evidence of myocardial inflammation, \nfibrosis or scar.\n- Unilateral lower extremity veins ___: No evidence of deep \nvenous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with medical history of COPD, ___ and recently \nhospitalization for hypoxia, rash and hypereosinophilia who \npresented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, worsening skin \nrash and Hypereosinophilia.\n\n#Eosinophilia: On presentation she was noted to have WBC 20.9, \nwith substantial hypereosinophilia (Eos 51 % and absolute eos \n10.66). She previously had an extensive work up for the cause of \nher eosinophilia (infectious, hematalogic, oncologic, \nrheumatologic, allergic) which was largely negative except for a \npositive strongyloides for which she was treated with Ivermectin \n(prior to this admission) without resolution of her symptoms. \nThis was ultimately thought to be a false-positive result based \non the fact that she actually had no exposure history. She was \nnoted to have eosinophilic lung and skin infiltrates as well as \nT-cell polyclonal predominance on BM. Tumor lysis labs (K, LDH, \nUric acid, transaminases) and a peripheral smear were sent (___) \nfor concern for acute malignant transformation leading to the \nprofound eosinophilia but were not consistent with an acute \ntransformation. She was followed by several teams including \nheme\/onc, pulm, derm and cards. It was felt that her \nhypereosinophilia was likely due to a secondary \nlymphocytic-predominant hypereosinophilic syndrome for which the \ntreatment is steriods. She was started on prednisone 40mg with \nrapid steady drop in WBC and %eos (___). The prednisone was \nincreased to 60mg (___) when the %eos was noted to have \nplateaued at ~10% on 40mg. She was discharged on Prednisone 60mg \nwith the plan to taper after %eos <5% in the outpatient setting. \nShe was discharged with close allergy and pulmonology follow-up.\n\n# Shortness of breath: On presentation to the ED she was \nafebrile and satting 89% RA. Labs were notable for a WBC 20.9 \nwith 50% eos (absolute eos 10.66)BNP 14000. She was also noted \nto have crackles and wheezing on exam. Pulmonary edema was noted \non chest X-ray. He SOB was thus thought to likely be due to her \nCOPD as well as an acute dCHF exacerbation. She received \nnebulizers and IV diuresis (lasix) with minimal improvement in \nher SOB. TTE to evaluate cardiac function showed LVEF >75% as \nwell as new LVOT obstruction, thought to contribute minimally to \nher symptoms. Given her history of markedly elevated Eosinophil \ncount and extensive work up (as above), eosinophilia-driven \ndyspnea was considered. She had a lung biopsy on a previous \nadmission which showed eosinophilic infiltrate but no evidence \nof granulomas. She was also noted to be ANCA negative. Cardiac \nMRI showed no evidence of eosinophilia infiltration or \nmyocarditis. Prednisone (for COPD) was initially held for fear \nof worsening her respiratory status in the setting of \nstrongyloides, however, given she had been treated for \nstrongyloides and that this diagnosis was much les likely, she \nwas started on prednisone. Continued diuresis and nebulizers did \nnot improve her symptoms substantially. Several teams were \nconsulted including Pulmonology, Dermatology, and Cardiology but \nthe etiology of the respiratory shortness of breath remained \nunclear. After considerable deliberation, the consensus was that \nshe likely had a lymphocytic-variant of hypereosinophilia \nsyndrome and she was started on prednisone 40mg with significant \nimprovement in her respiratory symptoms along with her COPD meds \nand gentle diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO QD to maintain an even \ntotal body water balance and stable daily weights. The dose of \nPrednisone was increased to 60mg just prior to discharge due to \na plateau as above. She was slowly weaned from 5L of \nsupplemental O2 and discharged on 1L O2.\n\n# ___ on CKD: She was noted to have a Cr on 1.5 on presentation \nfrom a baseline of 1.1  ___s K of 5.4. It was initially \nthought to be due to CHF exacerbation vs eosinophilia related \n(malignant proliferation vs direct damage). Tumor lysis labs \nwere mildly elevated but not suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome \nas the cause of the renal injury. She recieved IV diuresis \nwithout improvement. Nephrology was consulted and determined \nthat ___ was most likely due to ___ in the setting of agressive \ndiuresis and exposure to contrast given recent CT with contrast. \nUrine analysis was bland and not suggestive of eosinophil driven \nnephropathy. Creatinine returned to baseline with reduction of \nIV diuresis. Discharge creatinine was 1.3.\n\n# Rash: Appearance consistent with a drug rash but extensive \nallergy testing done prior and lack of new recent exposures made \nthis less likely. Skin lesion biopsied which showed superficial \nand deep perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils and focal \nspongiosis, suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction to \nsystemic antigen.  thought to be related to hypereosinophilia \nsyndrome. Improved with initiation of oral and topical steriods. \nAlso treated with Cetirizine, low dose Gabapentin, and several \nanti-histamines.\n\n#Hyperkalemia: Noted to have elevated K of 5.4 on admission. \nImproved as renal function improved as stated above. Noted to be \nagain elevated at 6.3 despite recovered renal function. Unclear \netiology but likely dietary. She states that she had been \ningesting K rich foods (tomato soups, melons etc). No sign of \nhemolysis on blood smear or highly metabolis states associated \nwith rapid turnover. Medications not likely contributory. She \nhad an EKG at the time which was normal. Got Lasix 40mg IV and \nKayexalate 30mg with recheck that showed K 5. Switched to low K \ndiet after which K downtrended and remained stable for the \nremainder of stay. \n\n# Hypertension: treated with Amlodipine 10 mg and furosemide \n40mg PO QD. Permissive hypertension was allowed given new LVOT \nobstruction. She will be somewhat preload and afterload \ndependent, and care should be taken not to reduce either of \nthese parameters substantially.\n\n# History of Seizures: Continued on home Lamotrigine, \nLevetiracetam, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin Sodium. levels were \nchecked after starting Prednisone to ensure therapeutic levels.\n \n# Full code\n\n***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***\n- Will need a repeat IgE, spirometry and lung volumes to assess \nresponse to treatment in the outpatient setting once steroid \ntaper commences. \n- Was found to have new LVOT with an increased gradient during \nthis admission. Should she develop dizziness, lightheadedness or \nsyncope, consider worsening LVOT as a possible etiology. Avoid \nover diuresis as well as aggressive preload\/afterload reduction.\n- hyperkalemia: resolved with low K diet. She should continue \nwith a low K diet.\n- discharged on Prednisone 60mg PO daily, will need taper\n- discharge weight: 98.6 kg, Discharge diuretic regimen: Lasix \n40mg PO daily\n- stable mediastinal lymph nodes noted on imaging: given \nrelative stability over time, it is less likely to be \nneoplastic, though an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder \ncannot be completely excluded and these should be followed in \nthe outpatient setting. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Subsequent \nmultiplanar T1-weighted imaging was performed after \nadministration of IV gadolinium.\n\nMR HEAD: A 3.7 x 1.8 cm right frontal parafalcine \nintraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema is \ngrossly unchanged in appearance compared to the CT performed \nearlier on the same day at 10:33. Regions of subarachnoid \nhemorrhage are also noted in the bilateral frontal and parietal \nlobes, also unchanged. A small amount of intraventricular \nhemorrhage is noted in both occipital horns. In addition, a tiny \nfocus of gradient echo signal drop-out in the right occipital \nlobe (9:10) likely represents a focus of microhemorrhage; no \nother foci of microhemorrhage are seen.\n\nThere is no shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, \nor loss of the basal cisterns. There is no region of diffusion \nabnormality to suggest underlying infarction. No region of \nabnormal enhancement is seen to suggest underlying mass. The \nnormal vascular flow voids are demonstrated. No MRI signs of \nvenous sinus thrombosis are seen. Decreased T1-weighted signal \nin the clivus may relate to myelodysplastic changes or an \ninfiltrative process. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air \ncells remain well aerated. The patient is status post bilateral \nlens replacement.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Right frontal parafalcine intraparenchymal hemorrhage, \nmultiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and tiny bilateral \nintraventricular hemorrhage unchanged. Tiny focus of \nsusceptibility artifact in the right occipital lobe may \nrepresent focus of microhemorrhage.\n2. No definite evidence of underlying mass, infarct or vascular \nabnormality.\n3. Decreased T1 signal in the clivus may represent \nmyelodysplastic changes in this patient with history of \nmyelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.\n___. ___. ___ ___ 1:25 ___\n\nRADIOLOGY  Final Report\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 9:12 AM\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\n\n___: ?PNA\n\nUNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:\n___ year old man with SAH, mild hypoxia\n___ FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n?PNA\nHISTORY: ___ male with subarachnoid hemorrhage, mild \nhypoxemia.

Comparison was made with the previous study of \n___.\n\nFINDINGS: Again a right posterior frontal intra-axial hematoma \nis identified with mild surrounding edema. The edema is slightly \nmore prominent than the previous study. There is no mass effect \nor midline shift seen. Again subarachnoid hemorrhage and \nintraventricular blood is identified which has not significantly \nchanged. No significant new areas of hemorrhage seen.\n\nIMPRESSION: Slightly more prominent hypodensity due to edema \nsurrounding the intra-axial hemorrhage in the right posterior \nfrontal lobe along the midline. This could be secondary to \nevolution.

However, the cranial \nvertex is relatively spared with respect to motion artifact, and \nnumerous foci involving the frontal and parietal lobes \nbilaterally demonstrate subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci \ninterdigitating with the gyri. Although there is surrounding \nedema, there is no apparent mass effect or midline shift of \nnormally midline structures.Parenchymal hematoma right cingulate \ngyrus may also be present.\n\nAlthough no fracture is definitely identified, severe motion \ndegradation limits the ability to detect a fracture.\n\nIMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the frontal and \nparietal lobes bilaterally. Because of significant motion \nartifact, it is not possible to assess for fracture.

While there is associated mild sulcal \neffacement, there is no shift of normally midline structures, \nand the basal cisterns are preserved. Multiple bilateral foci of \nsubarachnoid hemorrhages along the superior convexity are \ngrossly not changed. No definite new focus of hemorrhage is \nseen.\n\nThere is no evidence of acute large vascular territory \ninfarction or hydrocephalus. The previously seen \nintraventricular hemorrhage is no longer apparent. Evaluation of \nfine bony detail is somewhat limited by patient motion, however, \nthe visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are \ngrossly clear. Vascular calcifications are again noted in the \ncavernous carotid and vertebral arteries. The patient is status \npost bilateral lens replacement.\n\nIMPRESSION: Slightly more prominent edema surrounding posterior \nparafalcine right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, \nagain with sulcal effacement but without shift of normally \nmidline structures.

The right ventricular cavity is \nmildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The number \nof aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved \nbiventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid \nregurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension. \nICAEL Accredited \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nA\/P - ___ y\/o male with CAD s\/p NSTEMI x 2, seizure d\/o, MDS, \nlikely CHF, transferred to medicine service after neuro-surgical \nadmission after a fall, transferred to medicine after developing \nrespiratory distress and fever.  \n.  \n# Fever\/UTI - Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken. \nChest x-ray was most consistent with fluid overload rather than \npneumonia as was subsequent clinical course. He was started on \nciprofloxacin then narrowed to ampicillin for pan-sensitive \nenterococcus in the urine; he should be continued for a total of \n7 day course of antibiosis, which will be completed on ___. \n\n# Respiratory distress - due to CHF. Lasix was given with \nimprovement. An echo did not provide an obvious explanation for \nwhy he has a 2L O2 requirement at home after his MI, and it may \nbe that pulmonary follow-up would be appropriate to consider his \npulmonary hypertension. He was stable on his baseline O2 \nrequirement when discharged to the rehabilitation facility.\n\n# Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure\nAn echo was performed - results above. \n\n# Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was \ninitially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure \ncontrolled with IV nicardipine. Serial CT and clinical exam \nsuggest resolution; most recent CT scan showed mild cerebral \nedema without shift of any midline structures and resolving \nblood with resorption of intraventricular blood. Pt did not want \nanother MRA because of the length of the study and discomfort. \n  \n# DM:\n- glyburide initially held in case pt would require any \nprocedures that would require him to be NPO; restarting at 5mg \non discharge\n\n# seizure disorder: cont outpatient dilantin dose. Levels should \nbe monitored. Levels was 6.5 at discharge (with albumin 3.3)\n  \n#. MDS, myelofibrosis: Transfusion dependent.  \n- plan to keep HCT >21, and plt  >40K; ideally over 50K if \npossible atleast initially after bleed. His diastolic CHF does \nnecessitate an extra dose of lasix 40mg po with each blood \ntransfusion.\n\n# Transient hematuria was noted likely from foley trauma. \nResolved prior to discharge. Void trial is advised at rehab. If \nrecurs, suggest urology consult.\n\nCode: DNR\/DNI. \n\nThe patient was discharged to rehab for ___. Palliative care team \nhere also saw the patient at his and his wife's request and \ninformed them of hospice options. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Zocor 40 mg daily  \n2.

No small bowel obstruction. \n Oral contrast is seen to the rectum.\n5. New 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with type 2 diabetes, \nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, BPH, and three concurrent cancers: \n(1) metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, s\/p radical L \nnephrectomy in ___, found to have pulmonary,\nmediastinal, and hilar metastases ___ (now off sunitinib \nwithout disease progression), (2) metastatic cholangiocarcinoma \ns\/p 6 months gem\/cisplatin, who subsequently had new (3) acinar \ncell carcinoma of the pancreas, now on ___ I regimen of \nliposomal irinotecan and ___, last dose ___, who went to \n___ clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and was \nfound to have possible SBO on KUB.  This led to direct admission \nfor workup.  CT abdomen\/pelvis with oral contrast showed no \nevidence of bowel obstruction, but showed findings of ileitis, \nas well as increasing pancreatic mass size and new hepatic \nlesions all concerning for progression of his cancer.  While \nhospitalized, he developed recurrent symptoms of nausea, \nvomiting after an initial improvement, and then developed signs \nand symptoms of frank obstruction likely related to his \npancreatic mass or peritoneal carcinomatosis.  No further \nimaging was pursued.  An NG tube was placed for decompression \nand he had significant improved symptoms.  He subsequently \nunderwent palliative venting G-tube is a transition to hospice.\n\nACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:\n# Abdominal pain\n# Nausea and vomiting, with malignant obstruction, in setting of \nprogressive acinar cell cancer, and large pancreatic mass\n# Acinar cell pancreatic cancer\nHe has been off sutinib as his other cancers are being managed \nand his pulm\/hepatic mets have been stable. He is not yet due \nfor restaging imaging. He is due for\n___, LV, liposomal irinotecan. His oncologists are Dr ___ \n___ Dr ___ seen on ___.  CT abdomen\/pelvis showed \nincreased size of pancreatic head mass (from 6.0 to 8.0 cm), \nnumerous metastatic liver lesions (increased in size and \nnumber), interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, \nand new 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe.  He had \nbeen having nausea and vomiting likely related to chemo for \nseveral weeks, but then developed diarrhea, vomiting, and \nabdominal pain the night prior to presentation. His symptoms \nhave resolved.  He had 2 watery bowel movements after admission. \n KUB had showed multiple centrally located distended loops of \nsmall bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction.  He has not \nhad prior bowel obstruction.  Since he has only 1 kidney with a \nCr of 1.6, initial CT was done without IV contrast.  CT \nabdomen\/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel \nobstruction, but showed wall thickening of distal and terminal \nileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with infectious or \ninflammatory ileitis.  Since he was afebrile with improved \nsymptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started.  C. difficile \nwas negative as was ecoli.   He was initially treated with bowel \nrest and IV fluids, then diet was advanced.  The CT scan also \nshowed increasing size of pancreatic mass, enlarging and new \nhepatic lesions, new left lung nodule, worsening retroperitoneal \nlymphadenopathy, all concerning for progression of disease.   \nGiven this new complication of his pancreatic cancer, family \nmeeting was held on ___, with a decision to pursue hospice \ncare at home given no other therapeutic options.  His prognosis \nwas given as weeks.  He was transitioned to liquid concentrated \nmorphine for pain, as well as lorazepam for anxiety, and \ndexamethasone for nausea.  Oral medications were given after his \nPEG was placed, with clear instructions on how to take them.  \nThis included dexamethasone, concentrated morphine, and \nolanzapine.  Other home medications were continued at this time, \nwith decisions to stop these medications going forward to occur \nwith hospice services and Dr. ___, patient's \noncologist.  MOLST form was completed.\n\n# Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline hemoglobin is ___.  \nHemoglobin was low at 6.7 on ___, so he was transfused 1 unit \nPRBCs with improvement to 8.3.  He had no obvious signs of acute \nblood loss anemia and stool has not appeared grossly bloody or \nsigns of melena evident.  His blood count remained stable.  Labs \nwere not checked after goals of care were changed.\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n# Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine is 1.4-1.6 at baseline.  He \nhad recent ___ with Cr of 2.2 on ___ and 1.8 on admission, \nlikely due to dehydration. Renal function returned to baseline \nafter getting IV fluids then rose after he likely developed \nrecurrent dehydration.  As stated above labs were not rechecked \nafter goals of care change.\n\n# History of Portal Vein Thrombus: He was continued on home \nRivaroxaban 10mg daily, except for initially being held while \nNPO.  This was continued for now, but should be stopped if \ndecided not consistent with comfort going forward.\n\n# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition: He has low albumin and \nreported low oral intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal \npain, which has been ongoing off\/on for weeks, likely due to \nchemo and his known cancers.  Consulted nutrition who \nrecommended low fiber diet with Ensure Clear early in \nhospitalization, but given transition to hospice, he was \nrecommended to have diet as tolerated.\n\n# Type 2 diabetes: His glargine was initially decreased while \nNPO on IV D5LR, then stopped and treated with sliding scale \ninsulin only and Glipizide was held.  On discharge, glipizide \nwas continued.\n\nTRANSITIONS OF CARE\n-------------------\n# Follow-up: patient is being discharged to hospice.

She was transition to subcutaneous insulin with one hour \noverlap with gtt and maintained on IV fluids until ___, at \nwhich point her creatinine returned to baseline and she was \ntaking adequate PO fluids. Her nausea and vomiting had resolved \nprior to admission to the floor. She was restarted on her home \ninsulin regimen and her FSBGs remained mostly stable in the \n___. The trigger for this episode of DKA was most likely \nthe patient's UTI, treatment for this was begun immediately upon \nadmission as below. \n\n#ENTEROCOCCAL URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA on admission showed \ntrace leukocytes, 5WBC, few bacteria. The patient has a history \nof frequent UTI (likely ___ self-catheterization), although the \npatient denied dysuria. She was begun immediately on antibiotic \ntreatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Urine culture grew \nout >100,000 Enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin, after which \nthe ciprofloxacin was discontinued and the patient was \nmaintained on vancomycin until blood cultures from ___ showed \nno growth by ___. Prior to discharge, the patient was \ntransitioned from vancomycin to PO nitrofurantoin, on which she \nis discharged and will finish the remainder of a 10-day course \nat home. The patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic \nthroughout her admission. \n\n#ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: The patient presented with Crt 2.0 \n(baseline 1.0), most likely secondary to dehydration, with \npossible contribution from post-renal obstruction (patient had \nno urine output the day prior to admission). Acute rejection in \nthe setting of missing 3 doses of immunosuppressants is \npossible, but unlikely in this case with rapid response to \nintravenous fluid repletion. The patient was maintained on \nintravenous fluids until her creatinine returned to near \nbaseline (1.2) and remained stable, and she was taking adequate \nPO fluids. Her creatinine remained at baseline throughout the \nremainder of her admission. \n\n#ESRD S\/P RENAL TRANSPLANT: The patient missed 3 doses of her \nhome tacrolimus and Cellcept due to nausea and vomiting. She was \nrestarted on her immunosuppresant medications upon admission to \nthe hospital and her tacrolimus levels were trended and followed \nby the renal transplant team. Her renal function quickly \nreturned to baseline with IV fluid repletion. Acute rejection in \nthe setting of missed immunosuppressants was thought unlikely. A \nrenal transplant ultrasound on ___ showed no evidence of \nobstruction in the graft kidney. The patient's home vitamin D \nand calcitriol were continued throughout her admission.  She \nwill need to have her tacrolimus level checked one week after \ndischarge (___).\n\n#SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: On coumadin for antiphospholipid \nsyndrome.  She had an elevated INR of 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) on \nadmission likely due to drug-drug interaction between warfarin \nand ciprofloxacin. Her warfarin was held and INR was trended \nuntil it returned to her goal range. It was restarted at 3mg \ndaily on ___ following an INR of 3.5 the previous day. Her INR \nwas 1.1 on discharge, and she was instructed to measure her INR \nat home daily for the next several days and to communicate the \nresults to her ___ clinic for further titration of \ncoumadin.  Lovenox bridge was considered, but the patient \nreports having been subtherapeutic in the past without any need \nfor bridge.\n\n#TYPE I DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient was maintained on her \nhome dose of insulin Glargine (40U QAM and 30U QHS) as well as \nher home Humalog sliding scale, with stable daytime FSBGs. \n\nChronic issues: \n#ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID AB SYNDROME with H\/O PE: The patient's \nwarfarin was held due to a supratherapeutic INR as above and \nrestarted on ___. She will check her INR at home and \ncommunicate results with her ___ clinic as she has \nbeen doing. \n\n#CAD s\/p MI: Due to an episode of chest pain during vomiting \nbefore admission, she was ruled out for MI, with EKG only \nsignificant for right axis deviation that was resolving on \nfollow-up EKG. Her troponin was mildly elevated, peaking at 0.07 \nin the setting of demand ischemia due to tachycardia on \nadmission. She remained asymptomatic and was continued on her \nhome regimen of atorvastatin, metoprolol, and aspirin. \n\n#SCLERODERMA: The patient was maintained on her home dose of \n7.5mg prednisone daily with good symptom control.  \n\n#HYPERTENSION: The patient remained normotensive to slightly \nhypertensive during admission, with systolic blood pressures \nranging 120s - 160, with a one-time asymptomatic SBP of 188,. \nShe was continued on her home regimen of amlodidpine and \nmetoprolol. Her home valsartan was held until her Creatinine \nreturned near baseline and was restarted on ___.\n\n# GOUT: The patient was continued on her home allopurinol. \n  \n# PAD: The patient was continued on her home cilostazol 100 mg \nevery other day.\n  \n# DEPRESSION\/ANXIETY: The patient was continued on her home \nduloxetine and despiramine for depression and Ativan for \nanxiety. She was continued on her home trazodone and zolpidem \nQHS for sleep.  \n\n# HYPOTHYROIDISM: The patient was continued on her home \nlevothyroxine dose. \n\n# GERD: The patient was continued on her home ranitidine and \nNexium.  \n\nTransitional issues: \n# FOLLOW-UP: \n-Primary care: the patient will be contacted by Dr. ___ \noffice to schedule a follow-up appointment \n-Nephrology: the patient will be contacted by Dr. ___ \noffice to schedule a follow-up renal appointment within the next \ntwo weeks\n-Endocrinology\/diabetes: the patient will follow up with Dr. \n___ at the ___ on ___ at 3:30pm\n-___: the patient was scheduled to have an appointment \nwith Dr. ___ the ___ on ___ to plan for a breast biopsy.

You were found to have a very high blood sugar and acidic blood due to a condition called 'diabetic ketoacidosis'. Your kidney function was also temporarily decreased, most likely due to dehydration. Your blood sugars and your kidney function improved with continuous insulin and intravenous fluids. This episode of 'diabetic ketoacidosis' was likely triggered by a urinary tract infection, for which you were treated with the antibiotic medicine Vancomycin, and were switched to the oral medicine nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) before discharge, which you will take every 12 hours until the evening of ___. Finally, your INR was found to be higher than normal, so several doses of your home warfarin were held until the INR came back down to a normal level, at which time your warfarin was restarted.

He was initially relatively hypotensive \nwith SBP in the 80___ even while in NSR at a rate of 60bpm and \noff dilt drip. Unclear what provoked his PE as major risk factor \nis smoking. He notes having a colonoscopy with removal of polyps \n___ years ago without colonoscopy follow-up. There is note of a \n4mm uncalcified mass in his RML on CTA chest but unclear what \nthe significance is. Stool guiaiac negative. He was managed on a \nheparin drip initially and started on coumadin 5mg PO daily. He \nwas discharged home with 5 days worth of lovenox for bridging. \nHe will may benefit from an outpatient evaluation for unprovoked \nPE includig repeat colonoscopy, serial CT chest to eval \nprogression of mass, and perhaps hypercoagubility workup. He \nwill need, at a minimum, 3 months of anticoagulation with \ncoumadin for which he needs INR follow-up from his PCP to be \narranged.\n\n#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: CHADS 1 due to DM2. He \ninitially presented in RVR to a rate of 140's at OSH and was \ntransferred on a diltiazem drip. He rec'd 5mg IV metoprolol with \nconversion into NSR. This is apparently his ___ known episode of \nafib and he will need at least 3 months of coumadin for his PE \nbut otherwise aspirin 325mg is probably good enough protection \nfor stroke prevention. We believe his RVR was probably provoked \nby his PE\/bronchitis. His TSH was wnl's. He may benefit from \noutpatient echo to assess for structural disease. He was started \non metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily for rate control.\n\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES:\n------------------\n#DM2 Non-Insulin Dependent: A1c 10.6. On metformin as an \noutpatient. Based on his A1c he will likely need at least a \nsecond oral agent if not insulin. He was discharged on his home \nmetformin with aspirin 81mg daily.\n\n#Depression\/Anxiety: Stable. He was continued on his home \nklonopin and venlafaxine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n--------------------\n-The patient was FULL CODE during this admission\n-The patient was initiated on coumadin 5mg PO daily with lovenox \nbridging. We suggested checking his INR on ___, he will \nneed long-term management of coumadin\/INR for at least 3 months.\n-He had an unprovoked PE. He reports having a colonoscopy 10+ \nyears ago with removal of polyps but no repeat colonoscopies \nsince. He was guiaic negative but is due for a colonoscopy. He \nalso had a 4mm non-calcified nodule on his CTA chest from the \nOSH which should probably be followed with serial exams given \nhis smoking history.\n-He will likely need an increase in his diabetes regimen given \nhis A1c of 10.6. He is currently on metformin and will need at \nleast the addition of a second oral agent if not initiation of \ninsulin therapy.

The right \natrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are \nnormal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall \nleft ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = \n25%) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls \nand hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. Doppler \nparameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left \nventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free \nwall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is \nmoderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis \n(fractional area change < 0.15). The diameters of aorta at the \nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are focal \ncalcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. \n[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation \nmay be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation \nis seen. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \ncontractile dysfunction of both ventricles is now severe. \n\n==========================\nSTUDIES\n==========================\n\n___ DIPYRIDAMOLE NUCLEAR STRESS TEST\n\nINTERPRETATION: ___ year old female with a history of CHF (EF \n25%),\nCAD with probable old inferior MI, atrial fibrillation, DMII, \nHTN and\nHLD referred for nuclear study for evaluation of shortness of \nbreath,\nafter serial negative cardiac markers. The patient was infused \nwith\n0.142 mg\/kg\/min of dipyridamole over 4 minutes. The test was \nterminated\ndue to completion of the protocol. The patient reported no \nchest, neck,\nback or arm pain. Baseline NSSTTW's in the setting of RBBB \npersisted\nthrough infusion and recovery. No significant ST segment changes \nnoted.\nEKG showed atrial fibrillation with rare VPB's. Hemodynamic \nresponse to\ndipyridamole infusion was appropriate. The patient was infused \nwith 125\nmg of aminophylline to reverse effects of dipyridamole.\n\nIMPRESSION: No anginal or significant ST segment changes noted. \nNuclear\nreport sent separately.\n\n1. Moderate, fixed, inferior wall perfusion defect more severe \nat\nthe apical aspect.  Partial reversibility seen in ___ is no \nlonger appreciated.\n\n2.

Right lower extremity U\/S and \nCT did not reveal a DVT though calf veins were not well \nvisualized. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n==================\n# Right trochanteric bursitis\n# Right anterior lower leg pain\n# Right sided varicose veins\nPt endorsed >4mths of pain in RLE that became acutely worse over \nthe last few wks.  Her initial exam was most consistent with \nsevere trochanteric bursitis on the right. She also has some \nfocal pain along the right tibia which she felt was most \nconsistent with pain from her varicose veins. The XRs of her \ntibia\/fibula and right hip were without obvious pathology. There \nare no concerning neurologic symptoms to suggest a \nradiculopathy, no weakness or numbness though she may have some \ndegree of chronic sciatica.  Mildly decreased patellar reflex on \nthe right as compared to left may have been in the setting of \npain and guarding; strength was normal bilaterally as was her \nsensation. \nShe underwent U\/S guided steroid injection of her trochanteric \nbursa w\/ significant improvement in symptoms; ___ stated that \nthere was some fluid near the bursa, suggestive of acute on \nchronic trochanteric bursitis. Her anterior shin pain improved \nwith initiation of gabapentin and lidocaine patch in addition to \nher home tylenol and an increase in the frequency of her home \ntramadol (q8h PRN to q4h PRN).  Pt was not given her home \nhydromorphone PRN, though she did require one dose of 0.5 mg IV \nhydromorphone following her injection in the setting of an acute \npain episode. She was discharged with Tramadol 50mg x15 tablets \ngiven increased requirement. By discharge, she was able ambulate \nand was felt safe for discharge home with a cane per ___ \nevaluation.

Please \nsee below for more detailed hospitalization summary:\n. \n#Shortness of breath \/effusions, healthcare associated PNA: Mr. \n___ has longstanding COPD at baseline and requires home O2 \n2.5L nasal cannula. He arrived to OSH with notable dyspnea worse \nfrom typical baseline. This was initially attributed to possible \ndiastolic CHF exacerbation in setting of poorly controlled \natrial fibrillation. He was given generous amounts of IV lasix \nat ___ but continued to have some worse shortness of \nbreath. CXR showed bilateral effusions. However, review of older \nimages shows these are chronic, fairly stable effusions and seem \na less likely cause for acute worsened dyspnea. Given elevated \nWBC to peak 22k, recent malaise, poor PO intake and shortness of \nbreath there was clinical suspicion for underlying PNA with \nworse local inflammatory\/irritation and COPD flare up as patient \nwith very poor pulmonary reserve. The differential also includes \npossible underlying malignancy given his declining state x \nmonths, prominent smoking history and and note of pleural \nthickening on recent CT chest. In terms of CHF, recent BNP in \n1000s range, h\/o mainly diastolic CHF with EF 55% on TTE just \ndays ago. After concern for possible underlying complicated \nloculated effusion with CT chest questioning empyema, patient \nunderwent right sided chest tube placement at outside hospital \nbut no pleural fluid able to be collected. He was then \ntransferred to ___ ICU service with urgent \nthoracic surgery consult. Thoracic surgery team felt patient had \nvery minimal effusions on imaging and did not feel CT chest \nimaging constituted a true empyema picture. Thus, thoracic \nsurgery felt a repeat attempt at thoracentesis or any other \ninvasive procedures like ___ guided pigtail drain placement or \nVATS\/decortication would only be of minimal or no benefit given \nvery small amount of pleural fluid which was felt to be chronic \nas patient has had similar fluid at lung bases in previous \nimaging. Chest tube was removed in SICU and patient transferred \nto medical service where he was continued on plan for 8 days \ncontinued broad coverage for hospital acquired PNA with IV \nVancomycin and Zosyn. Blood cultures with no growth. Also \ncontinued patient on PRN nebulizers, Advair inhaler, Spiriva, \nchest physical therapy routine and he was eventually weaned down \nto usual home 2L O2 nasal cannula. At time of discharge he had \nno fevers, WBCs in normal range, and no complaints of cough or \nshortness of breath. \n. \n#Leukocytosis: Trend with initial rise from ___ admission and \nthen resolved after ___ days of being on IV Vancomycin\/Zosyn \ntherapy. WBC trend 10-> 22-> 19-->10--> 8 prior to discharge. \nRemained afebrile after his transfer to medicine service on \n___. Most probable source was underlying PNA. Although there \nwas some initial concern for UTI as his urine grew out coag \nnegative staphylococcus ___ only) at OSH. However, a repeat \nurinalysis and urine culture collected ___ showed no \nsignificant evidence for any UTI. Moreover, patient had no \ncomplaints of dysuria, urgency, or frequency. He had some mild \ntenderness over his abdominal midline and left side but he \nstated this was chronic and due to history of ventral hernia. He \nhad no concerning abdominal cramps, nausea or emesis prior to \ndischarge. He did have a few loose stools which were felt to be \na side effect of his antibiotics.  \nAs above, plan is to continue broad IV Abx with Zosyn\/Vancomycin \nfor HAP up until ___ for full 8 day course. \n.  \n#Right ___ DVT: Mild edema was noted on the right lower \nextremity. Imaging with ultrasound demonstrated a mixed picture \nof possible mixture of both some newer\/older thrombi. Patient \nvery immobile at baseline which increases his risk. He was \nstarted on weight based IV heparin gtt with close PTT monitoring \nand started on daily oral Coumadin with plan for at least 3 \nmonths of therapy.  His heparin was stopped on ___ when his \nINR rose to 2.3 (on 4mg of coumadin) on the evening of ___ he \ngot 2mg of coumadin.  His INR the morning of discharge was 5.1 \n(goal INR ___ and his coumadin is being held. His INR should be \nfollowed daily and coumadin restarted at 1 mg once his INR is \n<3. He will need 3 months of coumadin treatment for his DVT. He \nshould discuss with his PCP whether he needs to stay on coumadin \nlonger for his A fib. He has no significant GI bleeding in past \nbut he is a slight fall risk at this time which makes longer \nterm anticoagulation decision making more challenging as \nrisks\/benefits need to be discussed further. \n.\n#Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled with HRs ___ \n100s range. At home had been on PO diltiazem regimen and needed \nplacement on dilt drip, digoxin, and additional metoprolol while \nat ___. He was transitioned to once daily Toprol XL \n150 mg the morning of discharge. ******He did have one episode \nof emesis and a single dose of metoprolol tartrate 25mg was \ngiven as it is unclear whether he vomited his AM XL \ndose.********* His metoprolol dose will likely need to be \nfurther uptitrated for tighter HR control. He had a CHADS score \nof 3 and a concomitant diagnosis of RLE DVT and is on coumadin \n(currently with supratherapeutic INR as above). His worsing a \nfib could have been due to hypovolemia volume shifts vs. \ninfection as outlined above. He was ruled out for acute cardiac \nsyndromes with biomarkers at OSH. Digoxin was stopped early on \nin his admission and no additional diltiazem  was used as he did \nvery well on metoprolol po TID which was transitioned to toprol \nXL as above\n.\n#ARF: Baseline is near 0.9-1.0 range and peaked up to Cr 2.1 \nrange on ___. His creatinine was 0.9 on the day pf discharge. \nCauses include recent contrast exposure with CT studies, \npre-renal causes in setting of OSH lasix dosing. FeUrea <35% and \nurine electrolyte profile favored pre-renal causes. Renal \ndysfunction from antibiotics\/AIN was also considered but he only \nhad a very scant amount of eosinophils in urine making this less \nprobable.  Vancomycin was renally dosed and troughs monitored. \nHis vanco trough was 34.7 on ___ and 19.8 on ___. His \nvancomycin dosing was decreased to 1 gram q24 hrs and a dose was \ngiven the morning of ___. Gentle IVFs given to patient and his \nLasix was held for several days and his creatinine improved back \nto his baseline.\n.\n#Hypertension, benign: Well controlled and normotensive during \nhospital course. Continued on beta blocker as above with no need \nto add other agents. His home diltiazem was discontinued. \n.  \n#COPD, chronic: At baseline on home oxygen at 2.5L by time of \ndischarge. Currently has O2 saturations in the mid ___ range and \nhas no complaints of worse wheeze or shortness of breath. His \ncough has now resolved. As above, continued home Advair and \ntiatropium inhaler medications, gave nebulizers PRN, chest \nphysical therapy and treated PNA with broad antibiotics.   \n.\n#Chronic diastolic CHF: History of noted diastolic CHF. Recent \nnotes per ___ with last TTE EF%55, mild aortic stenosis, \nnormal tricuspid valve, normal pulmonary valve, no pulmonary \nhypertension. TTE findings similar to that from ___. Initially \nappears intravascularly hypovolemic to euvolemic on exam with no \nJVP despite mild overloaded picture on CXR. Very minimal ___ \nedema (R>L ; DVT RLE).

ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  \n \nCXR ___:\nPA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. \nTiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No \nsigns of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is \ntop normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly \ntortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There \nis no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged \nupper abdomen is unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.\n\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity \nsize and regional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF \n>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are \nnormal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch \nlevels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nstructurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of \nmild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic \npulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting \npulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular \ncavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular \nsystolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate \nmitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nseverity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and \nmoderate PA hypertension is now identified.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with h\/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes \nmellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, \nstage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and \nDOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. \nThe patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has \nbeen noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to \nthe floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. \nShe has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is \ncontributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand \nmyonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated \ntroponin.\n\n# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, \npatient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. \nHer only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs \nattributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin \nfell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting \nof renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to \nsuggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. \nShe was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for \nevidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to \n81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her \nLDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from \nsimvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues \nwith drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover \natorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at \ndischarge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that \nPlavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted \nand wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR \nin the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.\n  \n# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current \npresentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral \npleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE \nshowed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid \nregurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We \nchanged her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication \ncan be uptitrated as needed.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed \nwith our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended \nstaying away from clonidine. There has been a H\/O medication \nnon-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, \nand ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added \nlisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued \nnifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her \nrenal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to \nbradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing \nto help with compliance.\n\n# ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was \nwheezing on admission and responded to albuterol.

Atypical chest pain in the setting of known 3VD.  His known \nCAD has been managed medically given he is a poor candidate for \nsurgery.  He was ruled out for MI based on labs and EKGs. \nPatient is a poor history for his symptoms given his underlying \ndementia.  He was switched to metoprolol 25 mg BID, full dose \nASA, atorvastatin 80 mg while he was ruling out for MI.  \nLisinopril was briefly held as patient's wife was uncertain if \npatient takes it.  No stress test was done given the atypical \nnature of his chest pain, which could be GERD as it occurred in \nthe setting of a meal.  He was discharged on his home \nmedications which was reconciled again with his wife and the \nmost updated OMR medications.  This should be followed up by his \nprimary care physician and his cardiologist.  If there is a \nhigher suspicion of a cardiac etiology to this atypical chest \ndiscomfort, there is still room to increase Imdur and maximize \nhis medical management.  \n\n2.  Hypertension.  Mildly hypertensive during hospital course, \nlikely due to the holding of his lisinopril while the medication \nwas getting reconciled.  He resumed this medication upon \ndischarge.  He can continue to follow up with his primary care \nprovider.\n\n3.  Hyperlipidemia.  His recent lipid profile showed LDL of 68.  \nHe was briefly on atorvastatin 80 mg while he was in the process \nof ruling out for MI.  He was resumed on home statin upon \ndischarge.  This can be further followed by his primary care \nphysician.  \n\n4.  Type 2 Diabetes.  His oral medications were held briefly, \nand he was placed on a sliding scale.  Of note, his most recent \nHgbA1c showed 10.3.  He was discharged home with his prior \nmedications.  This should be followed up by the primary care \nphysician .\n\n5.  Multi-infarct dementia.  Patient continued on home \ngalantamine, citalopram, and seroquel.  Namenda was held briefly \nbecause wife was uncertain if patient takes this at home.

The aortic arch is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no \nmitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The \nleft ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. \nThe pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n\nNo vegetations seen.\n\nIf clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D \nechocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.  \n\nCXR ___\nThe PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. \nCardiomediastinal\nsilhouette is unchanged including mild cardiomegaly. Lungs are \nessentially\nclear except for scarring at the left lower lung laterally.

The cervical spine demonstrates a similar pattern of \nvertebral body signal intensity abnormality to that seen in the \nlumbar spine. This remains worrisome for malignancy.  \n2. Hyperintensity in the L3 and to a lesser extent L2 vertebral \nbodies on a single sagittal long TR, long TE fast spin echo \nacquisitions remain concerning for local neoplasm involvement \nwith paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities, better evaluated on \nthe lumbar spine MR ___. At this point, biopsy of \nthe L3, L2, or paraspinal tissue may be the best approach.  \n.  \nCT L-spine ___:  \n1. Loss of L2-3 disc height and erosion of the central aspect of \nthe inferior endplate of L2 and superior endplate of L3, which \nappears to be worse since the prior study. Associated \nhypodensity in the right psoas muscle is noted at this level. \nThis findings likely represent discitis osteomyelitis. No \nevidence of vertebral body collapse at this point. Contrast MR \nstudy is recommended to evaluate for epidural abscess and\/or \ninvolvement of the psoas and prevertebral soft tissues  \n.\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). \nTransmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic \nfunction, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen \non the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure is normal. No vegetation\/mass is seen on the pulmonic \nvalve. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant \nvalvular disease seen (good-quality study). Normal global and \nregional biventricular systolic function. In presence of high \nclinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic \nechocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.  \n.\nMicrobiology:\nL3 lumbar vertebral body biopsy:\n STAPH AUREUS COAG +.

Denied \nurinary retention\/fecal incontinence, no lower extremity \nweakness\/loss of sensation,Given his relatively unremarkable \nPMH, etiology is not entirely clear. However, per his PCP notes \nhe does get rather severe atopic dermatitis so skin breakdown \ncould have been a possible portal of entry.

The patient is intubated, the \nendotracheal tube \nprojects approximately 2.6 cm above the carinal. The patient \nalso has a \nnasogastric tube, the tip is not visualized on the image. \nFinally, the patient has a right internal jugular vein catheter. \nThe course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the \ncatheter projects over the upper to mid SVC. \n  \nModerate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and, \npotentially, a small left pleural effusion. The patient is ___ \nmild pulmonary edema. ___ addition, there is a rounded opacity at \nthe lateral and lower aspect 's of the right hilus, potentially \nrepresenting atelectasis. However, short term radiographic \nfollowup should be performed to exclude developing pneumonia or \naspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. \n\nCT CHEST W\/O CONTRAST ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \nAll of the pulmonary abnormalities could be due to atelectasis \nbilateral lower lobe, including collapse without bronchial \nobstruction.  Lesions ___ the posterior segment of the right \nupper lobe and particularly the lingula should be re-evaluated \nwith chest CT, contrast enhanced if clinically feasible, when \naeration improves elsewhere. Pulmonary hypertension. \nCardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. \n\nCT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1.

Repeat MRI \nmay be helpful for further evaluation. \n3. New aerosolized secretions ___ the sphenoid sinuses, \nopacification of the left mastoid air cells and fluid ___ the \nleft middle ear cavity. Please correlate clinically for acute \nsinusitis. \n\nEEG ___:\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study \nbecause of frequent blunted epileptiform discharges ___ bilateral \noccipital regions. These, only on rare occasions, have a high \nvoltage sharp morphology, ___ the bilateral posterior quadrants, \nphase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 and O2 or at \ntimes with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. \nAt times, these occur ___ brief runs at ___ Hz lasting up to \nfive seconds ___ the first half of the recording but do not \nevolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet criteria \nfor seizure. ___ the latter half of the recording, the frequency \nof the brief runs decrease to 0.5-0.75 Hz and predominantly have \nonly a blunted morphology. These sharp waves indicate \npotentially epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. \nAdditionally, there is a continuous pattern of severe diffuse \nbackground slowing fluctuating with a discontinuous burst \nsuppression pattern throughout the entire recording. These \nfindings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction \nwhich is non-specific as to etiology. The fluctuations of the \ncontinuous and discontinuous background pattern could indicate \neither fluctuation ___ severity of the severe diffuse cerebral \ndysfunction or effects of sedating medications. \n\nEKG ___:\nSinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prior anteroseptal and \nlateral \nmyocardial infarction. Slight ST segment elevation ___ leads \nV1-V2 with \nST segment depression and T wave inversion ___ leads I and aVL. \nST segment \nflattening and slight depression ___ leads II and aVF.

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or \nthrombi are seen ___ the left ventricle. There is no ventricular \nseptal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately \ndilated with normal free wall contractility. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic \nvalve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is \nseen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid \nregurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is \nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a \ntrivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no \nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.  \n\nMRA MRA BRAIN\/NECK W\/O CONTRAST ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \nStudy somewhat suboptimal; circle of ___ not completely \nincluded. \nAllowing for technical limitations, no flow-limiting stenosis or \naneurysm more than 3mm  of the circle ___ or vessels of the \nneck.

After concern for acute stroke \non MRI on ___, he was started on ASA 81 and\nAtorvastatin. He reportedly had R sided weakness for multiple \ndays prior to transfer but has been sedated on a propofol drip \nfor intubation. On arrival, he had a clear R hemiparesis and \npossible L facial weakness. By the time of extubation and \ntransfer to the floor Neurology service from the MICU, these \nsymptoms had resolved. His mental status was notable for \nintermittent disorientation to month, year, and location. He had \nmultiple anxiety episodes (which reportedly occurred frequently \nprior to admission as well) - these episodes improved with \nolanzapine which wasn't required for the 24 hours prior to \ndischarge. He was started on qHS trazodone for insomnia and \nnight time agitation. It may be worthwhile to repeat his MRI as \nan outpatient for prognostication purposes, though his exam is \nnow clearly improved.\n\n#Respiratory - Patient has been intubated 3x at OSH, each time \nfor hypercarbic respiratory failure.  There is also question of \npatient have altered mental status which contributed to \ndifficulty weaning from vent and need for intubation for airway \nprotection. He was successfully extubated after arrival to the \nFICU on ___.\n\n# CV - Patient with HAs, vision changes, elevated BP and CKD on \nadmission to OSH.

Low \nreticulocyte count with elevated ferritin and haptoglobin were \nconsistent with anemia of chronic disease. Given history of \npositive guaics (which resolved when the patient was put on a \nPPI), GI was consulted. EGD\/Colonoscopy were unremarkable. Any \nfurther evidence of persistently guiaic positive stools should \nprompt capsule study.

This caused nausea\/vomiting and headache and damage to your brain called posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on your Brain MRI. You also had multiple small strokes scattered throughout your brain on a repeat brain MRI. You initially required intubation for trouble breathing. You were transferred to one of our ICUs from another hospital for further management after it became difficult to extubate you. On admission, you had right sided weakness that improved over time. You were ultimately extubated and could breath on your own. Your blood pressure required multiple medications for management throughout the admission but we eventually kept your blood pressure controlled between ___ on multiple blood pressure medications. You had a low red blood cell count (anemia) during the admission which we thought was likely because of the stress placed on your body (anemia of chronic disease). You had a scope of your upper and lower gut to look for other sources of bleeds but these were normal. You had a bacterial infection ___ your blood and a pneumonia that required treatment with IV Vancomycin and IV Zosyn for 12 days. Your kidneys also showed damage from your likely long standing high blood pressure. Our renal service evaluated you and a kidney biopsy was done to confirm this diagnosis.

Small scattered hypodensities in \nthe right \nsubcortical and periventricular region are also seen on the \noutside study, \nconsistent with age-indeterminate infarcts. Diffuse \nperiventricular white \nmatter hypodensity is consistent with sequela of chronic \nmicrovascular \nischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are prominent with \nprominent \ntemporal horns of the lateral ventricles consistent with brain \natrophy and \nmedial temporal lobe atrophy. Atherosclerotic calcifications of \nthe bilateral \ncarotid siphons are noted. There is no evidence of intracranial \nhemorrhage.  \nThe visualized paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities, and \nmastoid air cells \nare clear bilaterally.

Hypoattenuating foci in the right periventricular region are \nconsistent \nwith age-indeterminate infarcts. If clinically indicated, MRI is \nrecommended \nfor determination of chronicity. \n3. Mild brain atrophy with medial temporal lobe atrophy and \nevidence of \nchronic microvascular ischemic disease. \n.\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 8:27 AM \nFINDINGS: Patchy linear opacities at the right base most likely \nrepresent \natelectasis. There is no definite focal consolidation or pleural \neffusion or \npneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with dense \ncalcifications at the thoracic aorta. There is a right chest \nwall pacemaker \nwith leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. \nA fracture of \nthe left fourth posterior rib is likely not acute. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Linear opacities at the right base are likely \natelectasis. No \ndefinite aspiration or focal consolidation. \n.\nCarotid U\/S ___\nPrelim read:\nnormal right system and 70-79% L ICA stenosis with high \nresistance in the left vertebral suggesting distal \nstenosis\/occlusion\n.\n.\nCardiology:\nTTE (Complete) Done ___ at 3:40:10 ___      FINAL \nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of \naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is \nborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a \ntrivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year-old right-handed male with a past history significant \nfor CAD, s\/p CABG, arrhythmia s\/p pacemaker, ESRD (not on \ndialysis), previous R CEA and recently dx T3 N0 posterior right \nposterior pharyngeal wall\/base of tongue ca s\/p chemo and XRT \nlast in past few weeks s\/p PEG ___ dysphagia who presented with \nacute onset right leg weakness on waking. Patient was initially \ntransferred to ___ where a CT scan was \nperformed that showed no acute process. He was then transferred \nto ___ for further evaluation. Patient was admitted on \n___ to the stroke neurology srvice and transferred to \nvascular surgery on ___. \n\nOn examination, there is no evidence of aphasia or other mental \nstatus abnormalities. Has a left carotid bruit (possibly \nsecondary to left B-C fistula) and CN examination reveals mild \ndysarthria with slight right face asymmetry and reduced gag \nbilaterally (likely chronic from esophageal ca surgery and XRT). \nOn limb exam patient has a right leg>arm hemiparesis with some \npossibly ataxic component (also has intention tremor on left) \nwith decreased sensation in right leg to light touch and \npinprick and slight reflex asymmetry with right extensor \nplantar. \n\nRepeat CT head showed a clear left ACA infarct and small vessel \ndisease. Carotid u\/s revealed a normal right system and 70-79% L \nICA stenosis with high resistance in the left vertebral \nsuggesting distal stenosis\/occlusion. TTE showed mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional \nbiventricular systolic function EF>55% and borderline pulmonary \nHTN. \n\nPatient was monitored on telemetry and patient was paced and no \nevents noted. Patient was treated with HISS to maintain \nnormoglycemia. Stroke risk factors were assessed and TSH 5.7, \nfasting lipid panel Chol 117 TGCs 140 HDL 39 LDL 50, HbA1c was \n5.6%. Additional labs revealed RPR, 12, foB12 and folate which \nwere normal. Anti-hypertensives were reduced to allow \nauto-regulation initially. Simvastatin was increased to 40mg and \npatent was initially changed from aspirin to clopidogrel and \nlatterly this was stopped and patient was treated with IV \nheparin with a goal PTT of 50-70 given likely embolic aetiology.\n\nThe most likely likely source of embolism is from a symptomatic \nsignificant left ICA stenosis.\n \nGiven significant left ICA stenosis, vascular surgery were \nconsulted. Although imaging with CTA would have been ideal, \ngiven his tenuous renal function this was deferred. Patient had \na L CEA on ___ and was transferred to the vascular surgery \nservice.  \n\nThe patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on \n___ after undergoing a left carotid endarterectomy. There \nwere no complications during the procedure and he tolerated it \nwell. He was initially mildly lethargic and not moving right \nextremities immediately post op. However, after spending some \ntime waking up in the PACU he became more alert and oriented and \nwas slowly regaining function of right side. He was transferred \nto the VICU in stable condition. \n \nNeuro: The patient received tylenol with good effect and \nadequate pain control. By the afternoon of POD 1, he was moving \nhis right extremities against gravity and with slightly more \nstrength than pre-op. He was neurologically and cognitively \nintact throughout.\n \nCV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;  \nvital signs were routinely monitored.\n \nPulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; \nvital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet, \nearly ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged \nthroughout this hospitalization.  \n \nGI\/GU\/FEN: \nPost operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF. After POD 1 \nmorning labs were stable, he was slowly advanced to his previous \ndiet after first passing a bedside swallow evaluation and then a \nmore formal evaluation by the Speech & Swallow team. He was \nrestarted on his tube feeds and advanced to nectar thick liquids \nand ground solids by the time of discharge, which was tolerated \nwell. The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, \nand IVF were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's \nelectrolytes were routinely followed during this \nhospitalization, and repleted when necessary.  \n \nID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were \nclosely watched for signs of infection. He remained afebrile \nthroughout. \n \nEndocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout \nthis stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. \n \nHematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined \nroutinely; no transfusions were required during this stay.\n \nProphylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during \nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as \npossible.  \n \nAt the time of discharge on POD 2, the patient was doing well, \nafebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a \nregular diet, moving all 4 extremities, voiding without \nassistance, and pain was well controlled.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nSimvastatin 20 mg Daily\nASA 81 mg Daily\nAmlodipine 10 mg Daily\nCarvedilol 25 mg TID\nLasix 40 mg Daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg Daily.\nIron 65 mg BID\nFluconazole 100 mg Daily.   \nIsosorbide 30 mg Daily.\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every \n4 hours) as needed for fever.  \n2. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n3. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n4. isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr \nSig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n5. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n6. carvedilol 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times \na day).  \n7. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

There \nremains some soft tissue swelling and gas consistent with the \nrecent surgery and this is stable. There are postoperative \nchanges involving the fifth ray, which are stable. There is a \nlarge os peronei adjacent to the cuboid.  Spurs about the \ncalcaneal tuberosity are present. On the lateral view, there is \na plantar soft tissue ulcer seen adjacent to the metatarsal \nheads. \n\n-TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 9:41:11 AM:\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is normal ___ size. Color-flow imaging of the \ninteratrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal \ndefect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this \nstudy. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is \nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity \nsize and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler \nparameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic \nfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion \nare normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and \narch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure is normal.

He had been seen ___ clinic earlier that \nday and labs drawn were significant for a leukocytosis; he was \nthus sent to the ED for evaluation. ___ the ED initial vitals \nwere: ___ 99%. He spiked a fever to 102.5. Labs \nwere significant for WBC of 17.7 with 90% PMNs, Na of 126, Cr of \n2.1, glucose ___ 500s. Lactate 1.4. He was placed on \nvanc\/cipro\/flagyl. Podiatry performed bedside I&D on ___. Blood \ncultures grew group B strep, group G strep. These also grew out \nof wound cultures; MSSA also grew out of the wound. He was taken \nback to the OR for further I&D on ___ and ___. Surface ECHO \nwas performed and negative for any mass or vegetation. WBC \ntrended down, though did have slight uptrend prior to discharge \n(14.2 on day of discharge). He was hemodynamically stable \nthroughout his stay. He was discharged on ertapenem 1g q24hrs at \nhome, to be taken for another 6-weeks, with stop date of \n___.\n\n# Type 2 diabetes: uncontrolled, last HbA1c was 13.6 \n(___). Patient was placed on his home medication which was \nLantus 40units qAM. Initially his FSBGs were high, requiring \nlarge amounts of sliding scale correction at mealtimes. However \nas his infection was controlled, his FSBGs were less that 200. \nGiven that not much adjustment was made to his insulin from \nhome, yet his sugars were much better controlled than his HbA1c \nsuggested, it was thought that his dietary discretion at home \nmay be playing a significant role. He was seen by nutrition for \ndiet education. He will follow-up with his PCP for further \ntitration of his insulin regimen. Given drug interaction, his \npreadmission simvastain was stopped and he was placed on \natorvastatin 20mg daily. He was continued on his ASA 81mg daily.\n\n# Acute on chronic kidney injury - Cr on admission up to 2.1 \nfrom baseline ~1.4-1.6. Likely due to hypovolemia from sepsis as \nhas improved with IVFs and ABx. At discharge his Cr was 1.7.\n\n# HTN: Prior to admission the patient was maintained on atenolol \nand lisinopril. His antihypertensives were intitially held due \nto severe infection. He was eventually placed back on lisinopril \nand uptitrated to 10mg daily. Additionally he was started on \namlodipine 5mg daily. His atenolol was held given his CKD. His \nBPs were maintained at SBP 120-130s on this regimen.\n\n# Anemia: Review of records show baseline Hbg of around 10. Labs \nfrom ___ consistent with chronic inflammation, which is likely \nstill the case given his chronic ulcers and current \nosteomyelitis. Hbg remained stable at ___ during this \nhospitalization.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================================================\n- Lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily.\n- Atenolol was stopped.\n- Amlodipine was started at 5mg daily.\n- Simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin 20mg daily (given \ninteraction between simvastatin and amlodipine).\n- He was discharged on 40units Lantus qAM. He will need to \nmonitor his FSBGs and likely need insulin adjustment as an \noutpatient based on his dietary pattern.\n- Discharged on Ertapenem 1g q24hrs, with stop date of \n___. All questions regarding outpatient parenteral \nantibiotics should be directed to the Infectious Disease RNs at \n___.\n- Needs weekly lab draw (CBC with differential, BUN\/Cr, AST\/ALT, \nAlk Phos, Total bili, ESR\/CRP).

Leftward axis. Intraventricular conduction \ndelay. \nInferior myocardial infarction, age undetermined. T wave \ninversions in \nleads I, aVL, as well as leads V2-V6 may be due to left \nventricular \nhypertrophy, although the contour also is consistent with \ncoronary ischemia and should be considered strongly. Clinical \ncorrelation is suggested.  Compared to the previous tracing of \n___ repolarization abnormalities are new and the rate has \nincreased. \n  Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n68 0 ___ 0 -26 173 \n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with coronary artery \ndisease, atrial fibrillation, congested heart failure, and \nmultiple other problems transferred from ___ \n___ for choledocholithiasis, hypotension and acute renal \nfailure, had a brief stay at the ICU before transferred to the \ngeneral medicine unit.\n\nWhile at the ICU, Mr. ___ was started on Flagyl 500 mg IV Q8H \nand Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H for 24 hours. He was given a \ntotal of 4500cc IV fluid during his ED and ICU stay. The ICU \nteam decided to postpone on Mr. ___ ERCP until ___ \nbecause he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable without \nleukocytosis. \n\nOn ___, patient was seen by hematology\/oncology consultants who \nperformed bone marrow biopsy to work up his acute on chronic \nanemia. Given chronic elevated MCV in the setting of normal \nfolate and B12, differentials then include alcohol, \nmyelodysplastic syndrome, liver disease, reticulocytosis, or \nmedications such as anti-metabolites. In Mr. ___ case, the \nfirst two causes were highest on the differential. Over the \ncourse of his stay, Mr. ___ hematocrit stayed around 25 \n(from a baseline of 31). He subsequently received two units of \nred blood cell transfusion, one in the evening of ___, and one \nin the early morning of ___, with subsequent hematocrit at 31. \n\nOn ___, Mr. ___ underwent ERCP for extraction of his \ncommon bile duct stone. The procedure had no complication. \nSphinterotomy was performed, and a single 15mm filling defect \nconsistent with a calcified round stone that was causing partial \nobstruction was seen at the lower ___ile duct. \nThere was post-obstructive dilation. The stone was not able to \nbe extrated at the time because of its size and calcification. A \n10 ___ 7cm stent was placed to enable drainage of the bile. \nPatient was told to return for a repeat ERCP in six weeks \n(___) for re-evaluation. A routine EKG done after ERCP \nshowed diffuse T wave inversion with asymmetrical T waves. CK \nlevels over the next ___ hours remained around 25, and Troponin T \nwas 0.1->0.1->0.07. Patient was asymptomatic throughout the \nepisode. No pre-ERCP EKG was available for comparison, and \ncardiology consult felt that these changes were unlikely \nischemic because the non-territorial nature of T wave inversion, \nand that similar inversions were noted in selected lead II in \ntelemetry from ___. It is possible that \nthe patient had a demand ischemic event in recent past, but in \nthe setting of recent acute kidney injury and anemia, had a mild \nelevation of cardiac enzymes that persisted. He was started on \naspirin, metoprolol, and statin. Heparin was not initiated \nbecause of the lack of symptoms, unclear timing and onset for \nthe elevated troponin, and the past history of upper GI bleed. \nEchocardiography on ___ (one day after the EKG change) showed \nejection fraction of 30%, a reduction from 40% in ___. It also \nshowed diffusely depressed left ventricular wall motion. His \nprimary care physician, ___, was informed of \nthese findings, and a stress test had been scheduled within a \nweek of discharge at ___ with his \ncardiologist, Dr. ___. He will continue to take aspirin, \nstatin, lisinopril and beta blocker (his heart rate was 75 with \nmetoprolol). Given that he had not previously been on statin, \nhis liver function test should be checked on an outpatient \nbasis, and this had been communicated to his primary care \nphysician.     \n \nMr. ___ also had acute kidney injury when he initially \npresented to us. \nFeNA was borderline (1.9%) but of uncertain value because \npatient was receiving IV bolus of lasix prior to transfer at \nOSH. This acute on chronic renal failure was likely secondary to \nhypoperfusion of the kidney, as the patient's blood pressure was \nin the ___ prior to transfer. His creatinine gradually \nimproved throughout his stay here, coming down from 3.1 to 1.8 \n(with his baseline at 1.4). His urine output was adequate, and \nrenal ultrasound was unremarkable. He was also hyponatremic on \npresentation, but the level improved after fluid restriction. \n\nMr. ___ also had a history of alcohol abuse, and throughout \nthis hospitalization he was given daily thiamine, multivitamin, \nand folate. His CT at ___ showed a \ncirrhotic liver with a hypodense lesion in the left liver lobe, \nand the team recommended that this be followed up on an \noutpatient basis, along with education on alcohol cessation. \nThis had also been communicated to the primary care physician.   \n\n  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications at home:\nIron sulfate 325mg PO BID\nHCTZ 25mg PO daily\nKCl 20 mEq PO daily\nLisinopril 10mg PO daily\nPrilosec 20mg PO daily\nDilantin 300mg PO qHS\nSpectrovite 1 tab PO daily\n.\nMedications on transfer:\nLevofloxacin 250mg IV x 1\nProtonix 40mg PO daily\nDilantin 300mg PO qHS\nK Clor Con 20 mEq PO QOD\nFerrous sulfate 325mg PO BID\nLisinopril 10mg PO daily\nHCTZ 25mg PO daily\nSpectrovite 1 tab PO daily\nProcrit 10,000 units SQ x 1 today\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were treated with fluid and antibiotics for presumed abdominal infection, and you were transferred to the ___, first in the intensive care unit, and then here on the general medicine floor. Your kidney function appears to be recovering now, but your anemia is still being worked up. The hematology oncology team here performed a bone marrow biopsy, and the result will be communicated to your primary care physician, and this can be followed up on an outpatient basis. You also underwent esophageal retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to evaluate your common bile duct stone. The stone was calcified, and its large size and integration into the common bile duct wall prevented a safe and swift removal with the ERCP. Consequently, a metal stent of 10 ___ diameter was placed to allow normal bile flow. After ERCP, your routine electrocardiogram showed new changes that were concerning for cardiac ischemia. We therefore underwent a series of blood test to assess whether your heart was sufferring from an acute injury. Over the next ___ hours, your cardiac enzymes, although slightly elevated, did not increase, and we concluded that the elevated level might be secondary to your suboptimal kidney function, rather than as a result of cardiac injury. You also underwent echocardiography as part of this evaluation, and it did not show any new cardiac wall motion abnormality suggesting heart muscle injury from ischemia; nor was there evidence of any acute cardiac event. Lastly, during your stay at the ___, a CT scan of your abdomen showed a cirrhotic appearing liver with a ~1cm hypodense lesion. This needs to be followed up with your primary care physician as an outpatient issue. You will have a repeat ERCP here at ___ in one month to re-evaluate your common bile duct stone and the newly placed stent. Given the change in your cardiac status, we decided to add several medications. You should continue to take metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvastatin. Please speak with your primary care physician as to whether you should continue these medications. If you remain on atorvastatin you will need to have your liver enzymes monitored. In addition, you will need to have a stress test within one week of discharge from the hospital. This may be arranged by your primary care doctor. Your lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were being held because of the decreased kidney function. Your lisinopril was restarted at half your normal dose on the day of discharge."}

Speech and language pathology \nconsutled, recommended soft ground diet and thin liquids, which \nwas advanced to regular solids. Nutrition consulted as well. If \nsymptoms fail to improve with liquid lidocaine and with a time \ncourse consistent with radiation esophagitis, will need further \nworkup as outpatient, such as barium swallow or EGD. Patient was \nstarted on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should \ncontinue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.\n\n# Hypernatremia\nPatient with rising Na this admission, up to 149. Likely poor \noral intake iso radiation esophagitis. Patient received 1L D5W \nwith improvement of Na to 141 on day of discharge. She was \nencouraged to maintain liquids throughout the day.\n\n# Severe Malnutrition\nPatient with poor PO intake and weight loss. Nutrition was \nconsulted, and per their recommendations she received Carnation \nsupplements with soy milk with meals, as well as Ensure Clear \nwith meals and multivitamins. PO intake was encouraged. SW was \nconsulted due to concern about her having adequate resources at \nhome (but she denies having issues with resources). ___ assessed \nher and recommended home, where she already has a walker. OOB \nwith assistance was encouraged during the admission.\n\n# Vitamin B12 deficiency\nB12 was noted to be low this admission, so the patient received \ncyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on PO \ncyanocobalamin daily. MMA was obtained, which was pending at \ntime of discharge. CBC was obtained daily.\n\n# Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma\nUndergoing concurrent chemoradiation. Will follow up with Dr. \n___ as outpatient.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n=================\n# Hypokalemia, chronic\nHypokalemia has been chronic. Etiology unclear as patient is not \non diuretics. Other etiologies include kidney dysfunction such \nas rental tubular acidosis. Reportedly does not take potassium \nas often as necessary at home d\/t difficulty swallowing pill. \nUrine\nelectrolytes notable for >20 K which seems inappropriate in \nsetting of hypokalemia. Potassium powder was trialed during the \nadmission.\n\n# Diarrhea, stable\nPatient reports loose stool since radiation. On admission did \nreport blood in stool that is streaky and superficial; patient \ndenied tarry stools or frank blood. The most concerning etiology \nwould be recurrence of colorectal carcinoma (s\/p hemicolectomy),\nalthough more likely causes include diverticulosis flare or \nhemorrhoidal bleeding. Cdiff negative. Hb stable throughout this \nadmission.\n\n# Tobacco Abuse: Managed inpatient with nicotine patch. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===========================\n[] Ensure that patient is eating and drinking without difficulty\n[] Continue to assess for presence of blood in stools\n[] Should repeat CBC and BMP at next PCP visit to ensure stable \nHb and Na\/K\n[] Previously on potassium tablets, but discharged on potassium \npowder given odynophagia, will need to follow up with ability to \ntolerate this.\n[] Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of \nGERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.\n[] Found to have B12 deficiency anemia during this admission, \nreceived cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on \nPO cyanocobalamin daily, which she should continue.\n[] Follow up on lab tests that were pending at time of \ndischarge: campylobacter stool culture, stool ova + parasites, \nfecal culture r\/o Yersinia, methylmalonic acid.\n[] Patient was scheduled for outpatient CT chest ___, unable to \ncomplete as an inpatient, will need to be rescheduled by her \noncology team\n\n==========================\nCODE: Full Code (confirmed)\nEMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: ___ (daughter)\n___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Ms. \n___ was referred to ___ after a blood pressure reading at \nan urgent care facility was 240\/108. In terms of her blood \npressure, she normalized to her baseline values of around \n140-160 during her admission while she was on her home \nmedications. From the perspective of her gait instability, there \ndid not appear to be an acute process. A neurology consult \nconcluded that this was likely not a central process (stroke) \nand thus referred her for outpatient follow-up. \n \n#Gait instability - Ms. ___ endorsed a ringing in her ears, \ndizziness with movement of her head, and some unsteadiness while \nwalking. With CT imaging that did not show an acute process and \nwith her clinical picture, she is most likely to have a \nperipheral issue such as vestibular neuritis or labrynthitis. \nHer neurology consultation concluded that she could be \nfollowed-up as an outpatient. A ___ consultation concluded that \nshe was safe to return home with physical therapy services. At \ndischarge, she was stable and claimed to feel her presenting \nsymptoms less. \n\n#Hypertensive urgency: Ms. ___ has a ___ history \nof uncontrolled hypertension with readings, as per Atrius her \nBPs have ranged at baseline from 140-180. Her presentation of \nunsteadiness was most concerning for intracranial bleed which \nwas ruled out with a CT head.  No other signs of end-organ \ndamage (no headaches, chest pain, vision changes) and gait \nunsteadiness did not coincide with symptoms).  She was continued \non her home regimen of clonidine, verapamil, and lisinopril and \nher blood pressure remained controlled throughout her \nhospitalization.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# Leukopenia- chronic per atrius records  \n# Hyponatremia- chronic per atrius records usually mid ___- low \n130s etiology unclear. \n# PMR- c\/w home dose pred. on ca\/vit d for ppx  \n# Hyperlipidemia- c\/w simvastatin  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Follow-up with PCP, consider home BP monitoring\n- Follow-up with Neurology for evaluation of gait instability \nand dizziness. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Please correlate \nclinically as a distal obstruction is difficult to exclude.  \nMRCP is recommended for further evaluation. \n2. Pancreas divisum. \n3. No bowel obstruction in this patient status post gastric \nbypass surgery. \n4. Retained catheter in the right body wall extending into the \ncentral spinal canal for which clinical correlation is advised. \n\nCTA HEAD\/NECK ___\n1. Normal CTA of the head. \n2. Patent vasculature in the neck with no evidence of internal \ncarotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. \n3. No acute intracranial abnormality. \n\nUPPER GI SERIES ___\nNo evidence of esophageal dysmotility or anastomotic stricture \nto explain \nsymptoms. \n\nRUQ ULTRASOUND ___ile duct stones.  Ectatic common bile duct measuring \n9 mm may \nreflect s\/p cholecystectomy.\nADDENDUM  Upon further review of the the images the duodenum is \nthe \neccentrically thickened in the region of the ampulla which \nraises concern for a periampullary mass best seen on series 1a, \nimage 41 and series 1b, image 263\/351.  Further evaluation with \nERCP or PTC if ERCP is unsuccessful is recommended. \n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n================================================================\n\nENDOSCOPY:\n----------\n\nEGD ___\nAnatomy consistent with known Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The \nstomach pouch was small. The GJ anastomosis was carefully \nexamined and appears intact, with no ulcers. (biopsy: normal)\nNormal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy: normal)\nOtherwise normal EGD to jejunum\n\nEUS ___\nLinear EUS was performed with the Olympus enchoendoscope at \n7.5mHz. A focused\/limited EUS evaluation was possible given the \ngastric bypass anatomy, which does not allow EUS visualization \nfrom the duodenal bulb (for critical distal biliary and \nampullary view). The PD was measured at 2.2mm in the body, and \n2.5mm in the head, which is normal diameter. The intrahepatic \nbiliary system was slightly dilated, and the extrahepatic \nCHD\/CBD was only mildly dilated (maximum diameter 7.8mm), within \nthe normal limits for post CCY state. The CBD cannot be traced \nto the ampulla because of the gastric bypass anatomy. No filling \ndefects or mass is seen.\nLimited eval with EUS scope notable for gastric bypass anatomy \n\nRecommendations: Will need careful review of prior CT scans from \n___ and ___. Biliary dilation is \nlikely benign\/post CCY. This can often be more prominent after \ngastric bypass ___ et al J. Gastro Surg ___. It is \nimportant to demonstrate stability over time. If prior scans \nshow no biliary dilation, then can consider single balloon to \nevaluate ampulla and further surveillance imaging to rule out \nmass. \n\nCOLONOSCOPY ___\nPolyp at 20cm in the distal sigmoid colon (polypectomy)\nNo bleeding seen.\nOtherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ yo woman s\/p Roux-en-Y ___ years ago with \nh\/o nutritional deficiencies, Behcet syndrome, hypothyroidism, \ndepression and chronic pain, who presented with nausea, \nvomiting, RUQ pain, and weight loss.\n\n# FAILURE TO THRIVE: Presented with ongoing weight loss and very \npoor ability to tolerate PO, reportedly eating only 2 6-oz \nyogurts daily. Failure to thrive was thought largely nutritional \nin setting of this very poor PO intake. However she is on \nsignificant opiate regimen which was thought to contribute as \nwell both from standpoint of GI motility and mental status. \nOpiates were downtitrated as below with some improvement.\n\n# NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Patient with chronic post-prandial \nnausea\/vomiting. Imaging was remarkable only for biliary \ndilatation (see below) with no evidence of obstruction or other \netiology of nausea\/vomiting. She underwent EGD to evaluate her \nanastomosis; this was normal. Nausea\/vomiting thought likely \nmultifactorial due in part to high dose opiate use and decreased \nGI motility, as well as inability to tolerate large volumes of \nfood s\/p Roux en Y. Opiates decreased, she was seen by \nnutrition, and was tolerating POs well prior to discharge. \nRecommend consideration of referral for bypass revision if \nnausea\/vomiting continues.\n\n# BILIARY DILATATION: Patient presented with intermittent \npostprandial RUQ pain and significant RUQ tenderness on exam. \nShe is s\/p remote cholecystectomy. CT identified significant \nbiliary dilatation which could not be further elucidated with \nMRCP given that patient has retained pain pump catheter in \nintrathecal space. RUQ ultrasound identified area concerning for \nperiampullary mass. EUS was done but did not visualize any such \nmass. Patient will follow up with her PCP and GI. COmparison \nwith prior imaging and consideration of repeat imaging to \ndetermine if any interval change is recommended.\n\n# NARCOTIC USE FOR CHRONIC PAIN: Patinet with long standing \nchronic pain of somewhat unclear etiology as well as high dose \nopioid use with recent dose increases correlating to time course \nof her FTT. Fentanyl patch was decreased from 100 to 75 mcg\/h. \nREcommend considering further decrease on discharge, as well as \npain clinic referral.\n\n# CONCERN FOR HORNER'S SYNDROME: Patient with left sided \nHorner's syndrome on exam, also with decline of mental status. \nWas seen by neurology who recommend CTA head\/neck and CT of \nupper chest. THese were unremarkable except for ___ cerebral \natrophy. Recommend outpatient follow up\/neuropsychiatric \ntesting. \n\n# S\/P ROUX EN Y: Continued B vitamin, MVI. Labs here revealed \nslightly low B2 and otherwise no deficiencies.\n\n# HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH normal  here. Continued home synthroid.\n\n# DEPRESSION: Somewhat poor mood without SI.

With regards to the urinary symptoms, she was \nfound to have a UTI, and was started on antibiotics with \nimprovement, with plan for completion of 7-day course of \nciprofloxacin. With regards to the confusion concerning for \nhepatic encephalopathy, this was assessed and felt most likely \nto be precipitated by the urinary infection. Her mental status \ncleared with initiation of lactulose\/rifaximin, and she was \ndischarged with plan for continued lactulose therapy to reduce \nthe chance of future episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. With \nregards to the paracentesis site, it was no longer leaking upon \narrival to the floor. It was monitored closely and her abdomen \nwas assessed by ___ for tappable pocket given concern for \npossible SBP, with small pocket of straw-colored fluid obtained. \nThe fluid analyses showed evidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low \ntotal protein (0.9), and negative neutrophil criteria for SBP \n(PMNs 235), without any culture growth to date at the time of \ndischarge.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n============== \n#Decompensated EtOH cirrhosis c\/b volume refractory ascites \n#Concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis \nThe patient has a history of refractory ascites secondary to her \ncirrhosis which has historically required frequent LVP (~5L, \n___. When the patient reported to her outpatient \nhepatology office following her most recent paracentesis (___), \nshe reported ongoing leakage of yellow fluid from her \nparacentesis site necessitating ___ dressing changes\/day, \nwithout any ascites reaccumulation. Per patient, this has \nhappened once before with a prior paracentesis and self-resolved \nafter ___ days, nonetheless, her outpatient hepatologist Dr. \n___ was concerned that she might have an evolving complication \nat the site of the paracentesis and sent her to the emergency \nroom for further evaluation. By the time the patient arrived at \nthe ___ ED on ___, the drainage from the paracentesis site \nhad dramatically decreased; and by the time she reached the \nfloor on the morning of ___, the drainage had entirely stopped, \nwith only scant yellow drainage appreciable on the gauze \npadding. Despite the cessation in drainage and quiescent \nappearance of paracentesis site w\/o erythema or induration or \npurulence, given the potential for clinically silent SBP she \nunderwent ___ assessment for tappable pocket, during which 20 mL \nof straw-colored fluid were obtained. The fluid analyses showed \nevidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low total protein (0.9), and \nnegative neutrophil criteria for SBP (PMNs 235), negative gram \nstain, without any culture growth to date at the time of \ndischarge, and thus low concern for SBP at this point.\n\n#UTI:\nThe patient's UA on admission showed nitrites and rare bacteria, \nand subsequently grew out pan-sensitive E-coli. Despite absence \nof urinary symptoms (dysuria, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort, \nflank tenderness), given altered mental status and laboratory \nfindings was treated for presumed UTI, initially with CTX (___) \nwith subsequent transfer to ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID with plan \nto complete seven day course. \n\n___: \nThe patient was noted to have a Cr bump to 1.3 from admission \n(up from baseline 1, has been as high as 1.7 in past). She has \nknown b\/l renal cysts demonstrated on US imaging as recently as \n___. Her change in Cr this admission was felt to be most \nlikely pre-renal in the setting of volume depletion from the \nUTI. She did not meet criteria for further evaluation for HRS, \ngiven no evidence of ascites, and Cr <1.5. Her Cr remained \nstable at 1.2-1.3 during the admission; she was discharged with \nclose outpatient hepatology follow-up. \n\n#Hepatic Encephalopathy: \nPrior to this admission, the patient had no history of hepatic \nencephalopathy and reported regular BM ___ without \nlactulose. However, on days preceding this admission she became \nmore forgetful, and was noted to have b\/l asterixis on admission \nexam and to have confusion about day of the week, concerning for \nfirst-episode of hepatic encephalopathy, likely triggered by her \nurinary tract infection. She was evaluated with US and lab w\/u \nfor concomitant clot or bleed trigger, and this work-up was \nnegative. She was treated with lactulose\/rifaximin and her \nmental status cleared, with concomitant improvement in her \nasterixis. She was discharged on maintenance lactulose taken as \nneeded with titration for goal ___ BMs\/day, with plan for close \nhepatology follow-up. \n\n#Screening\/Maintenance \nThe patient's status with regards to screening and surveillance \nwas assessed as a component of routine inpatient cirrhosis care \nto ensure ongoing optimization. With regards to vaccination, she \nwas noted to have had both pneumococcal vaccines (completed \n___ influenza this year (___), HAV vaccination \n(___), and HBV immunity by serologies (___), with the \nmajority of this information documented in the ___ \nsystem. With regards to malignancy screenings, her last ___ \nscreening was ___, and showed coarsened hepatic echotexture \nwith nodular capsular contour, and no masses concerning for ___. \nWith regards to behaviors mediating her cirrhosis, she reported \nno current alcohol use, with last drink ___ months ago. \n\n#GERD:\n- The patient reported she had not been taking the omeprazole on \nher PAML recently due to issues with insurance coverage of \nomeprazole. She experienced some GERD symptoms during the \nadmission, predominantly burning in chest, w\/o frank sense of \nacid refluxing back to her throat or other symptoms, which she \nassociated temporally with the initiation of the \nlactulose\/rifaximin. She was treated symptomatically with \ncalcium carbonate for these symptoms and improved; we recommend \nthat she follow up with her primary care provider about \nalternate GERD medication if her symptoms continue to be \nbothersome, as detailed in transitional issues. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES \n============== \n#HLD: \n- The patient's home simvastatin was continued during the \nadmission without issue. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \n============== \n-NEW MEDICATIONS: The patient was started on one new long term \nmedication this admission, lactulose 30 mL PO\/NG TID with goal \nto titrate to ___ daily.

The degree of MR seen has decreased. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with \nincreased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or \nelevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern \nfor pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme \nleak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent \ncardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, \nlactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary \nedema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who \ntransferred the patient to cardiology floor.\n\n# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation\/mitral regurgitation: \nLikely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in \nworsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior \nwall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac \ncath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically \nwith lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was \nconsulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair\/replacement. \nHowever, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high \nrisk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made \nto revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient \nwould regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a \nbare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in \nthe diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her \nmitral regurgitation. \n\n# NSTEMI\/CAD:\nAs evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was \nbriefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac \ncatheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed \n3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with \naspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As \nthe patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to \nthe cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will \nrequire plavix for at least 1 month.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued \nnifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. \nShe was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.\n\n# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. \n \n# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently \nat baseline. \n\n# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. \n\n# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be \nscheduled to follow up with the first available CMED \ncardiologist. \n* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal \nstent placement = ___.\n* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her \ninsurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10\/month).\n* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still \nhypertensive. \n* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ \nsecondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Pathology at ___ showed eosinophilia in lung \nspecimen however ___ Path reports that there were no \neosinophils in lung parenchyma just in capillaries. No \ngranulomas to suggestion sarcoidosis. Pulmonolgy was consulted \nfor evaluation of pulmonary hypereosinophilia and recommended \nsending studies for infectious (strongyloides, cocciodiomycosis, \naspergillus, HIV) and inflammatory (ANCA, IgE, IgG subclass) \ncauses of hypereosinophilia. HIV was negative; ANCA was \nnegative. Heme-onc was consulted and recommended sending studies \nfor lymphoproliferative (CD3-\/CD4+) causes of hypereosinophilic \nsyndrome as well as cellular mutations associated with \nneoplastic proliferation of eosinophils (tryptase, JAK2, \nBCR-ABL, PLP1L1-PDFGRA and rearrangements of PDGFR and FGFR1) \nand indicatiors of cell turnover (LDH, B12, troponin). LDH, B12, \ntroponin were within normal limits. They also recommended a \nworkup for occult malignancy given evidence of lytic bone \nlesions on chest CT from ___. The patient \nunderwent breast U\/S of L sided breast lump which was negative. \nUPEP\/SPEP and kappa\/lambda from ___ were negative. \nCT abdomen and pelvis from ___ showed no evidence of \nmalignancy, and mediastinal lymph node biopsy from ___ showed no \nmalignant cells. Steroids were initially held due to concerns of \nallergic and infectious causes of hypereosinophilia. The patient \nreceived benadryl for treatment of pruritis.\n\n# Complex seizure disorder: The patient was on four AEDs at \nadmission: lamictal 150 2 pills BID, Keppra 500 two pills BID, \nphenobarbital 32.4 two pills BID, dilantin 100mg two pills BID. \nShe had been on these AEDs for many years prior to presentation. \nThere was some concern at ___ that one of these \nmedications may have been contributing to her eosinophilia. Her \nlamictal dose was reduced by 30% prior to transfer to ___. She \nwas initially maintained on the reduced dose of lamictal and on \nher home doses of her other AEDs in consultation with her \nprimary neurologist Dr. ___. She underwent patch testing of \nthese four AEDs, which showed did not show any signs of drug \nallergy to these medications, but the sensitivity of this test \nin general is low.\n\n#dCHF: EF 65% in ___. On admission chest xray, the patient \nhad evidence of pulmonary edema (___), which may have been \ncontributing to hypoxemia in addition to her baseline lung \ndisease. She underwent diuresis with her home PO lasix 40mg with \nadditional IV 40-60mg lasix throughout her admission with \ngradual improvement in her O2 requirement. At time of discharge, \nweight was 98.1 kg. Discharged on Lasix 40mg po BID (previously \n40mg po daily at home). Will f\/u w\/ ___ CHF service. Room air \nsat 92% at rest, and desatted to 85% w\/ ambulation but quickly \nrecovers. Discharged home w\/ O2 w\/ exertion.\n\n# COPD:  Patient was treated for a COPD exacerbation with \nantibiotics at ___ prior to transfer to ___. \nGiven positive strongyloides, she was not given steroids \nthroughout her hospitalization, and the pulmonology team felt \nthat she did not need steroid treatment. She was given albuterol \nnebulizers as needed for wheezing, though these did not produce \nimprovement in her O2 requirement. \n\n# HTN: The patient's blood pressure was elevated on presentation \nto ___, likely in the setting of her home BP agents \n(amlodipine, furosemide, olmesartan) being held at the outside \nhospital. She was restarted on her home amlodipine and given \nPO+IV furosemide as above. Her olmesartan was held due to \nhyperkalemia.  \n\n# Hyperkalemia: Patient had persistently elevated potassium \nthroughout admission (max ___. Her medications were reviewed \nwith pharmacy and were felt to not be contributing to her \nhyperkalemia. Given hyperkalemia and eosinophilia, she had AM \ncortisol testing to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency, which \nshowed cortisol >20 making this unlikely.\n\n# LLE radiculopathy: Patient had left leg shooting pain daily \nthroughout her admission, starting in the hip radiating down the \nleg. She had a normal neurologic exam during these episodes. She \nreported that this was a chronic problem previously diagnosed as \nsciatica, treated with tylenol at home. She was given tylenol \nand PRN oxycodone and tramadol for the pain with subsequent \nrelief in her symptoms.\n.\n##TRANSITIONAL ISSUES##\n- F\/u with PCP and check ___ (patient aware; creat 1.3 \n___\n- Patient is due for a screening mammogram and pap smear and \nshould have these scheduled after discharge\n- Please ensure pt is up to date on all age appropriate cancer \nscreens.\n- Pt due for 3rd dose of Ivermectin on ___\n- patient scheduled for multiple f\/u appointments as listed \nabove\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Your blood tests and biopsies from ___ ___ showed that you had high numbers of eosinophils, a type of blood cell, in your blood, skin, and lungs. To evaluate the cause of these findings, you were seen by the hematology, pulmonology, and allergy services, who reviewed your records and your prior imaging and recommended several lab tests. These teams were concerned that one of your anti-seizure medications was contributing to your symptoms. You underwent patch testing to see if you were allergic to those medications, which was negative. You had many tests sent looking for infections that can cause high number of eosinophils, which showed positive strongyloides, a type of worm that can come from dogs. You had studies looking at autoimmune and inflammatory causes of high eosinophils, which were negative. You also had blood tests to look for cancers in the blood that can cause high eosinophils, which were negative. You had a breast ultrasound, which did not show anything concerning in your breast. You had a chest xray that showed some extra fluid that may have been contributing to your low oxygen, so we gave you some extra lasix to remove some of the fluid, which led to a resolution of your oxygen requirement."}

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system \nrevealed \nno significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and \nRCA \nwere all normal without angiographically apparent flow limited \ndisease. \nThe LCx had a large ramus branch. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right \nsided \nfilling pressures with mean PCWP 29mmHg and RVEDP 15mmHg.  There \nwas \nsevere pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 69 mmHg. \nCentral aortic \npressures were normal at 137\/80 with a mean of 97 mmHg. \n3. The mean mitral valve gradient was 13.5 mmHg and calculated \nMVA 1.23 \ncm2 with excellent hemodynamic tracings, oxygen saturation \nconfirmed \nPCWP and reversed transducers.  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. \n2. Moderate mitral stenosis with valve area 1.23 cm2, mean \ntransmitral \npressure gradient 13.4 mmHg. \n3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. \n4. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n. \nTTE ___\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or \ncolor Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and \nglobal systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an \nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve \nshows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate \nthickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality (body habitus). \nCharacteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with \nelevated transvalvular gradient suggestive of moderate mitral \nstenosis. However, visually the mitral valve appears more \npliable. This elevated gradient may be due to an underestimate \nof the severity of mitral regurgitation in the setting of \nmoderately thickened mitral valve leaflets and chordal \nstructures. Alternatively, it may be that the subvalvular \nstructures are more thickened\/deformed and adversely affecting \nthe effective mitral valve orifice than is able to be \nappreciated on transthoracic imaging. \nGiven the internal inconsistencies on the current study, a \ntransesophageal echo for further characterization of the mitral \nvalve apparatus is recommended.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nseverity of mitral stenosis is qualitatively similar but the \nmitral valve area has decreased from 1.8 cm2 to 1.3 cm2 on the \ncurrent study. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension has markedly decreased and the right ventricular \nfunction has improved.  \n.   \nTEE ___ (preliminary)\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of \nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal \ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending, \ntransverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter \nand free of atherosclerotic plaque to 33 cm from the incisors \n(the probe was not advanced past the GE junction due to hiatal \nhernia). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are \nseen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.The mitral valve \nshows characteristic rheumatic deformity with bowing of the \nanterior leaflet and tethering of the posterior leaflet motion. \nNo mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is \nsevere valvular mitral stenosis (mean gradient 15mm Hg). Mild to \nmoderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with severe \nmitral stenosis. Mild ot moderate mitral regurgitation. \nPreserved global LV systolic function.\n.  \nTTE ___ \nLimited and focused imaging. Left ventricular wall thickness, \ncavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). \nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n.  \nTTE ___\nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows \ncharacteristic rheumatic deformity. There is severe valvular \nmitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to \nacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be \nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Severe rheumatic mitral \nstenosis. Grossly-preserved biventricular systolic function.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nfindings are similar. Both studies were focused on excluding \npericardial effusion. \n\nTTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:06:59 AM      FINAL \nThe left atrium is elongated. A small atrial septal defect is \nsuggested (clip 76) but could not be confirmed. Left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal \nwall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.9cm2). \nAn eccentric jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be \ndetermined. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ \n(pervalvuloplasty), the severity of mitral stenosis is markedly \nreduced and the mitral leaflets are more mobile.  \n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was admitted to the cardiology service. Her CXR on \nadmission showed likely worsening pulmonary edema on a \nbackground of ILD. Given lack of focal infiltrate, leucocytosis, \nand fever, abx were stopped. Steroids or other immunsupression \nwere held at the recommendation of her primary pulmonologist. \nShe was diuresed with IV lasix. Right and left heart cath was \ndone and showed no obstructive CAD, elevated PCWP, and MVA \n1.23cm2. Repeat TTE showed normal EF and moderate mitral \nstenosis, but was a limited study given body habitus. It was \nfelt that she may benefit from mitral valuloplasty as mitral \nstenosis was the best explanation for her recurrent CHF and \nelevated wedge pressures. During her time on the cardiology \nfloor, she was satting high ___ on ___, which the patient uses \nat home, and appeared to be breathing comfortably. TEE was done \nto look for evidence of thrombus. In the cath lab on ___ \nwhile attepmting valvuloplasty, when crossing the wire \ntranseptally, there was entry into the aorta. The case was \naborted, and the patient was transferred to the CCU for closer \nmonitoring.    \n. \nThe patient had a TTE post-procedure that showed no pericardial \neffusion or changes in the aorta.  She remained hemodynamically \nstable overnight in the CCU.  She continued to be diuresed with \nlasix.  Her insulin sliding scale was uptitrated for \nhyperglycemia.  The arterial and venous sheaths were removed \nfrom her groin the following day.  Repeat TTE demonstrated no \ninterval changes with no pericardial effusions.  She was called \nback out to the cardiology floor. CXR Pa\/Lat was ordered for AM \nafter call-out both to assess fluid status and to better \nevaluate possibility of underlying infectious process. Repeat \nCXR was much improved without pulmonary edema. Decision was made \nto take pt back for valvuloplasty on ___. Procedure was \nsuccessful and without complication; gradient improved (see ECHO \nand procedure report for full details). Pt's clinical status was \nmonitored for an additional day and lasix was titrated.

She was walking through a store to buy medications for \nher constipation and she became lightheaded, weak, and she fell \nto the floor and hit her head. She endorsed epigastric pain \nprior to event but no other prodrome of diaphoresis, nausea, or \ntunnel vision. The event was thought to be due to pulmonary HTN \nfrom\nchronic COPD as her TTE showed elevated PA pressures as well as \na possible orthostatic component. She was given gentle fluids \nand her Lasix was held but resumed at a decreased dose prior to \ndischarge.  She was also given prednisone 30mg PO daily, \nlevaquin 250mg daily, and started on albuterol nebulizers. She \nwas discharged on 2L NC with plan to get outpatient PFTs. \n\nShe states that she has not been the same since discharge.  She \nused to be  able to walk her dog around the block multiple times \nbut in the past month, she has been so short of breath she has \nnot been able to walk her dog at all. The most activity she is \nable to perform is chores around the house.

Reportedly at the OSH her ECG was concerning for \npossible atrial fibrillation w\/ complete heart block and both \natropine and transcutaneous pacing were attempted prior to \ntransfer. Of note, on arrival to ___ she was noted to be in \natrial fibrillation w\/ slow ventricular response and rates \n___. Sequence of causality is unclear: ie, if patient was \nbradycardic leading to decreased renal perfusion and thus an \nacidosis or if patient was acidotic due to renal failure (or \nother cause) leading to bradycardia. However, given lack of \nother end organ damage, more likely the latter. Her troponins \nwere negative so unlikely to be ischemic in etiology. She is on \nhigh doses of metoprolol and Diltiazem at home and denies taking \nmore medications than prescribed. On arrival, the pt was briefly \non a dopamine drip. In this setting, her metoprolol and \ndilitiazem were held and her metoprolol was slowly reintroduced. \nHer Bradycardia resolved. \n\n#Pulmonary Hypertension \nThe patient had evidence of volume overload with elevated JVP \nand lower extremity edema consistent with right sided heart \nfailure exacerbation. However with diuresis, the patient became \northostatic. RHC showed severe pulmonary hypertension. Likely \ngroup III iso oxygen dependent COPD but evaluation for other \ncauses was recommended by pulmonary. Group I work up included \n___, ANCA, CCP, anti-centromere pending at time of discharge, \nC3: 110, C4: 23, RF: <10, anti-RNP: negative, HIV: negative. She \nis s\/p RUQUS with doppler for portopulmonary HTN: No evidence of \nporto-pulmonary HTN. Group III work up: was unable to acquire \nfull PFTs - (spirometry, DLCO, lung volumes), has appointment on \n___. A Non con CT chest: demonstrated emphysema. Regarding \ngroup IV workup, a VQ scan was performed without evidence of PE. \n\n#HFpEF\nPatient with new diagnosis of HFpEF with evidence of right-sided \nHF likely secondary to COPD given elevated RV pressures on her \nTTE, right axis deviation\/low limb lead voltage on her EKG. She \nis chronically on 3L but had an increased oxygen requirement \nintitially. She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix but this \nwas ultimately held given mild ___. TTE this admission notable \nfor RV dilation w free wall hypokinesis. She was diuresed with \nIV Lasix transitioned to torsemide. Held ACEi in the setting of \n___. Received metoprolol as above, continued to hold diltiazem. \nImdur was discontinued given absence of angina. Continued with \nIV Lasix lead to orthostatic hypotension and RHC was done to \nevaluate for volume overload. PCWP was normal at 10 and CI was \nnormal at 2.82. PA pressure was ___ (47) consistent for severe \npulmonary hypertension as above. At discharge, diuretic was her \nhome dose of furosemide 10mg PO. \n\n#Atrial Fibrillation\nCHADS2VASC of 5 on warfarin. INR supratherapeutic on admission, \ninitially held diltiazem and metoprolol iso of bradycardia. High \ndoses of AV nodal blocking agents suggest that she has difficult \nto control rates. She had intermittent bouts of AF w\/ RVR to \n150s while her nodal agents were being held. We restarted her \nmetoprolol and uptitrated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6H (her \nhome dose of metop) and consolidated to 100mg succinate prior to \ndischarge. Anticoagulation was continued with warfarin 3 mg \nafter correction of coagulopathy. \n\n#Coagulopathy\nOn arrival pt's INR was supratherapeutic to 6.0 with prolonged \nPTT and decreasing platelets. Possibly in the setting of \ncongestive hepatopathy vs. due to changes in her PO intake prior \nto arrival. She was given PO vitamin K for three days, w\/ \nnormalization of her INR. Fibrinogen normal, blood smear showed \n1+ schistocytes. Warfarin was restarted as above. \n\n#Iron Deficiency Anemia \nPt w\/ Hgb ___ this admission. Required intermittent pRBC. Her \niron studies are consistent w\/ Fe deficiency anemia (Ferritin \n31, TIBC 300, Fe 17). Stool guaiac positive, but brown. Likely \nslow lower GI bleed iso supratherapeutic INR. INR reversed with \nvitamin K and Hgb stabilized. She should undergo EGD and a \ncolonoscopy as an outpatient, but had adamantly refused \ninpatient evaluation. She received IV iron repletion x3 days. \n\n#Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: \nPatient with non anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory \nacidosis. Bicarbonate is chronically around 18 but ph was 7.16 \non presentation. Non anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to \nrenal failure from worsening heart failure or injury due to \nhypotensive event. She required small quantities of bicarb \ninitially before her pH normalized. Renal was consulted while \nshe was inpatient and improved without intervention.\n\n___ on CKD: Patient has been seen by nephrologist with workup \nnotable for negative spep, upep. Baseline creatinine in ___ \n~1.5. Give exertional dyspnea, lower extremity dyspnea, and \nvolume overload, likely pre-renal from decreased effective \ncirculatory volume. Cr was 2.8 on admission and improved \ninitially with diuresis. Diuresis was restarted with increase in \nCr. on discharge Cr was 1.7. \n\n#Positive blood cultures \n#Leukocytosis \n#Possible Cellulitis\nShe was briefly on vancomycin for possible GPC bactermia, but \ngiven speciation as CoNS only in one bottle, suspect this may \nhave been contaminant. She had a full infectious workup which \nwas negative and we transitioned her to Keflex to complete a 5 \nday course for cellulitis (___). \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#Diabetes mellitus: on levemir 10U SQ qhs so switched to \nglargine 10mg qhs with sliding scale insulin while inpatient.\n\n#COPD: Baseline 3L of home O2 with extensive smoking history. \nContinued Advair.\n\n#gout: continued allopurinol, dose reduced to every other day in \nsetting of worsening renal function. \n\n#CODE: DNR\/okay to intubate \n#CONTACT\/HCP: ___ ___ (son) \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \n=====================\n[] Recommend performance of Full PFTs - spirometry, DLCO, lung \nvolumes, which are scheduled at ___ on ___. \n[] Recommend follow up with a pulmonologist (she preferred to \nsee a provider closer to home as outpatient follow up in ___ \nwill be challenging for her to keep.) If possible outpatient \nfollow-up should involve a local Pulmonologist (at ___) and PH \nspecialist at ___. She has had relatively extensive pulmonary \nhypertension workup however still needs PFTs. We have scheduled \nan appointment for her on ___ at ___ with a pulmonary \nhypertension specialist. \n[] Recommend referral to a cardiologist given her bradycardia \nwith heart block on admission and further titration of nodal \nblockers.\n[] Few small lung nodules measuring up to at most 4 mm. These \nare very likely benign, but noting emphysema may be appropriate \nto consider follow-up chest CT for surveillance in ___ year. \n[] Pt w\/ iron deficiency anemia this admission w\/ Hgb ___. Her \nstool was guaic positive, but pt did not have any BRBPR or \nmelena, so suspecting slow ooze.

Left lower lobe opacity is \ncompatible with atelectasis and\/or pneumonia. \n\nTTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left \natrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated \nThere is abnormal septal motion\/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure\/volume overload. The ascending aorta is \nmildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An \neccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the \nregurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with \nthe prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), the degree of \npulmonary pressures is much lower (likely underestimated as the \nIVC was not well visualized). No vegetations or abscesses \nvisualized.\n\nTEE ___: No vegetations seen on the cardiac leaflets. No mass \nor vegetation seen on the cardiac wires. Simple atheroma aortic \narch. At least moderate in severity eccentric mitral \nregurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to \nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  \n\nBLE Ultrasound ___: Limited study demonstrates no evidence \nof right or left lower extremity DVT. \n\nCXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the \nposition of the \ntracheostomy tube and of the pacemaker wires is unchanged. \nUnchanged moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of \natelectasis and substantial enlargement of the vascular \nstructures at the lung hilus. Unchanged moderate pulmonary \nedema. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. \n\nWBC scan ___: 1. Splenomegaly. 2.

MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent \nbacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood \ncultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite \nappropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent \nseeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both \nnegative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his \npacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult \nfocus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity \nultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot \nbut was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced \nat ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he \nhad negative blood cultures.  He was continued on vancomycin and \ndosing was changed to 1g q48h.  Further blood cultures were \nnegative.   Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular \nsource but it was not found during this hospitalization.  He \nshould be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date \nof his last positive blood culture, with last day ___.\n\n#. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an \nindwelling foley it was suspected that this might be \ncolonization however his cultures were positive even after \nchanging his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his \nurine as well as wound culture.  It was multidrug resistant \npseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day \ncourse.  He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when \ntrough < 1.  He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his \nurine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last \nday ___. \n\n#. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his \nMRSA bacteremia.  Other cultures returned positive as above.  He \nalso had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with \nseptic arthritis.  His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line \nholiday.  He was ruled out for C diff.\n\n#. Acute renal failure: BUN\/creatinine elevated to 70\/1.7 on \nadmission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor \nforward floor from chronic systolic CHF.  His creatinine slowly \nimproved with diuresis.\n\n#. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical \nventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to \ntrach mask for any length of time.  This was felt to be related \nto chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial \npulmonary edema.  Diuresis was difficult due to his large \nobligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix \n80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid.  His metolazone may \nneed to be decreased over the next several days if he is \noverdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen \nfor the few days prior to discharge.  On the day of discharge, \nhe was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the \n300's.\n\n#. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during \nthis admission.\n\n#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his \nhome carvedilol.  His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely \nand was not restarted due to renal failure.  He was diuresed \nwith IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his \ncreatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing \ndiuresis.\n\n#. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV.  He was started on a \nfentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control.\n\n#. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure \nremained stable during this admission.  He is off \nanticoagulation due to h\/o GI bleeding and hemothorax.  He was \ncontinued on carvedilol. \n\n#. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who \nrecommended the following:\n1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid \nmanagement. Turn q 2 hours.\n2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry.\n3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft \nsorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily.\n4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and \nwrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape.\n5. No tape on skin.\n6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days.\n7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to \nassist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with \nMepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days.\n8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal \ntissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to \nassess with edema.\n9. Waffles bilateral feet.\n10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily.\n11. Support nutrition and hydration.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Monitor I\/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given \nlarge doses of lasix and metolazone.  ___ need to back off on \nmetalazone if signs of overdiuresis.  However, would continue to \naim for -500cc daily I\/O balance.\n- Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM.  Give tobramycin \n320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0.\n- Continue vancomycin until ___ for MRSA bacteremia.  \nShould have trough measured intermittently to assess for \nappropriate dosing.\n- Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment\n- Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if \npossible.  Diuresis should help with this.\n- Please draw weekly labs: CBC\/diff, chem-7, LFTs and fax to \nInfectious disease R.Ns. at ___.

Speaking \nin short phrases with significant SOB.  Pt was found still found \nto be hypoxic upon arrival to the medicine service, which was \nthought to be due to PE vs. COPD vs pneumonia. After he was \ntransferred to our service, we obtained a CTA to rule out PE.  \nThe CT did not show a PE and confirmed the fact that his COPD \nwas very severe, and it was thought that his baseline O2 sat \nwere likely 88-92% at home.  He had been placed on antibiotics \nfor possible pneumonia prior to transfer to medicine; he was \ntreated with Levofloxacin for presumed PNA started on ___, as \nwell as duonebs q6 and tramadol for pain.  On ___, per CXR, it \nappeared his PNA had cleared.

Possible subtle ectasia of the \ndistal left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery.  \nEKG: NSR @ 69 bpm, normal axis, incomplete RBBB, LVH w\/ \nsecondary repolarization abnormalities, LAE  \n\n___ Renal artery Doppler:\nNo evidence of renal artery stenosis in the left kidney and \nlikely no stenosis in the right kidney however the Doppler \nexamination is somewhat limited due to the patient's limited \nability to hold his breath. \n\n___ TTE:\nThe left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is severe \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is mildly depressed (Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 46%) \nsecondary to mild global hypokinesis with slightly worse \nfunction of the basal-mid inferior and inferoseptal walls. \nTissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular \nfilling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall \nis hypertrophied. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus \nlevel. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is \nmildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are \nstructurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild \n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic \nregurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery \ndiastolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial \neffusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\n IMPRESSION: Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nmildly depressed global and regional systolic dysfunction and \nincreased filling pressure. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild dilatation of the \nascending aorta and arch. Very small pericardial effusion.\n\n Findings are suggestive of hypertensive myopathy (with possible \nunderlying CAD), although an infiltrative process cannot be \nexcluded.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ Portugese-speaking man w\/ PMH of HTN who presents the \nemergency room for evaluation of high blood pressure.  \n\n#Hypertensive urgency: \nPatient presenting with BP of 260\/150 at his PCP ___. \nAsymptomatic other than a headache, without signs\/symptoms of \nend organ damage. BNP mildly elevated without prior comparison, \nEKG w\/ LVH, trop neg x 2, Cr at baseline. Renal artery Doppler \nwith no evidence of renal artery stenosis. He was previously on \na 4-drug regimen of hctz, lisinopril, nifedipine, and \nmetoprolol. Labetalol was initiated in the ED with resultant \nbradycardia to ___. Started on chlorthalidone 25mg daily, \namlodipine 10mg daily, lisinopril 20mg daily, and carvedilol \n12.5mg BID with improvement in blood pressures. \n\n#Cardiovascular disease risk\nPatient at increased risk for cardiovascular disease given \nlongstanding poorly controlled hypertension. Significant LVH \nnoted on EKG. EF 45% with significant LVH and wall motion \nabnormalities seen on TTE. ASCVD risk 16% based on TC of 224, \nHDL 49. ___ 154. HbA1c 5.9%. Started on ASA 81 daily, \nAtorvastatin 40mg daily. \n\n#Transaminitis: Mild elevation, AST:ALT ~1:1. Initially thought \nto be due to NASH given obesity (BMI 31.5). Last viral \nserologies from ___ showed hep A immunity, otherwise \nunremarkable. Hepatitis serologies sent, which were negative.  \nTransaminitis resolved on repeat labs, suggesting it may have \nbeen to mild hepatic ischemia in the setting of hypertension. \n\nTransitional Issues\n===================\n-Continue to monitor BP and adjust blood pressure medications\n-Patient started on lisinopril, should have lytes checked at \nfollow up appointment\n-He needs outpatient work up for CAD given focal wall motion \nabnormalities on TTE\n-Continue counseling on importance of medication compliance\n-Continue ASA\/statin; continue to monitor cholesterol and \nconsider titration to high intensity statin if inadequate \nresponse to moderate intensity. \n\n# CONTACT: Wife, ___, ___ or ___ \n# CODE STATUS: Full code (confirmed) \n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He exercised \n9.25 minutes of ___ protocol ___ METS) and stopped due to \nfatigue. This represents an excellent physical working capacity \nfor his age. He denied any arm, neck, back or chest discomfort \nthroughout the test. There were no significant ST segment \nchanges throughout the study. The rhythm was sinus with no \nectopy throughout the study. There was an appropriate blood \npressure and heart rate response to exercise.\n.\nIMPRESSION: No ischemic EKG changes or anginal type symptoms. \nEcho report sent separately. \n\nEcho:\n\nThe patient exercised for 9 minutes 15 seconds according to a \n___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate \nof 142 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 156\/54 mmHg. The test \nwas stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise \nrepresents a very good exercise tolerance for age. In response \nto stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see \nexercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure \nand heart rate responses to stress.\n\nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 75 bpm and a \nblood pressure of 112\/60 mmHg. These demonstrated normal \nregional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right \nventricular free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no \naortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral \nregurgitation or resting LVOT gradient.\n\nEcho images were acquired within 56 seconds after peak stress at \nheart rates of 133 - 115 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate \naugmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight \ndecrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right \nventricular free wall motion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Very good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 2D \nechocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved \nworkload.\nSuboptimal study - sub-optimal image quality during \npost-exercise acquisitions.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSummary: ___ yo male with a history of CAD (2 DES placed into LAD \non ___, hyperlipidemia, HTN, and smoking history presenting \nwith left chest tightness.\n\nCORONARIES: The patient has known CAD with a cath report from \n___ and an intervention with placement of 2 DES into the \nproximal and distal LAD (lesions were hazy though FFR showed \npressure gradient difference). At that time, he only had single \nvessel disease. The patient presents with a different type of \ndiscomfort than his previous anginal pain. Cardiac enzymes x 3 \nwere normal and there were no EKG changes. The patient did not \nexperience any discomfort during the hospitalization. He was \ncontinued on Plavix, high dose aspirin, lisinopril and a statin. \nA beta blocker was held because he had an adverse reaction to it \nin the past. Since his discomfort was different than his prior \nand his last cath was only 2 months ago, it was decided to \nperform a stress echo on the patient. The stress echo was normal \nrevealing excellent physical endurance and a very good \nfunctional exercise capacity without ECG of 2D echo evidence of \ninducible ischemia. On discharge, the patient was given a \nprescription for sublingual nitroglycerin. He has a PCP \nappointment on ___ and ___ planned to have his PCP organize \ncardiology followup.\n-follow cardiac enzymes\n.\n# Dyslipidemia: From ___ his lipid panel showed LDL calc: \n75, HDL: 41, ___: 122, Total choleterol: 122. He was advised to \nincrease his simvastatin 10 mg dose for a goal of LDL<70. On \ndischarge, the patient was given a prescription for pravastatin \n20 mg daily because it will provide cost savings. \n\n# Left foot drop and associated numbness: The patient complains \nof difficulty pushing on the ball of his left foot. The physical \nexam revealed ___ dorsiflexion of the foot and sensory loss on \nthe lateral aspect of the calf wrapping on the the arch of the \nfoot. He did not have any back or neck pain. The remainder of \nhis neurological exam was normal. Since his symptoms are only \ndistal, they might be due to compression of a nerve. He was \ngiven an appointment at the neurology urgent clinic for further \nevaluation. \n\nOutpatient followup:\n1. Check LDL if at goal\n2.

The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Heart \nis borderline in size. Degenerative changes of the spine are \nnoted. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo ___ speaking F with CAD, chronic ear infection who \npresents with presyncope and fall at home.  \n.  \n# Presyncope: Likely orthostasis in setting of HCTZ use and \npossible mild dehydration. Hyponatremia may have also \ncontributed. Patient ruled out for MI. Neurological exam had no \nfocal deficits. There was no evidence of infection, however \nurine cx was pending at discharge. Patient has bradycardia ___ \nSSS, but this is a chronic issue and patient is asymptomatic \nwith bradycardia on the floor, and responded appropriately to \nexercise.  No events on tele. Patient was not orthostatic after \nreceiving gentle IVF. Physical therapy consult cleared patient \nfor independent ambulation with walker. \nHCTZ was discontinued. Patient will have her BP monitored off \nthis medication by her PCP, and may require a replacement \nmedication. Amitrityline was another candidate for causing \nconfusion and falls, however patient has noted benefit from this \nin terms of headaches. If falls continue, could consider \nstopping Amitrityline as well. \n. \n# Hyponatremia: Patient has h\/o hyponatremia in setting of HCTZ, \npossibly with mild SIADH component as well (since Na did not \ncompletely normalize when taken off of HCTZ). Patient had brain \nMRI as outpatient which showed only moderate microvascular \ndisease, which is unlikely to explain hyponatremia. Patient does \nhave evidence of COPD on CXR, but no other intrathoracic \npathology to cause SIADH. Urine osm were intermediate, so no \nclear SIADH picture. \nPatient did start taking HCTZ taking on her own over the last \nfew days for leg swelling. This likely accounted for worsened \nhyponatremia at admission. After holding the HCTZ, giving IVF, \nand encouraging POs, sodium was in normal range.   \nPatient was instructed not to take HCTZ, and to instead use \ncompression stockings for leg edema. \n.\n# Lower extremity edema: This was very consistent with chronic \nvenous insufficiency. Patient describes swelling that only \noccurs over the course of the day, and improves with rest and \nelevation. She has not been wearing compression stockings. \nOtherwise patient had no evidence of volume overload on exam. \nShe is at risk for CHF given CAD and past MI, and should \ncontinue to weight herself daily.\n.  \n# Sick sinus syndrome: Followed by Dr ___ as \noutpatient. No need for pacemaker given appropriate response to \nexercise. This episode is highly unlikely to be cardiac in \netiology. Sinus bradycardia on tele. Asymptomatic.  \n.\n# L gluteal pain: No fracture noted on L-spine films. Likely \nsoft tissue trauma from fall.    \n.   \n# Hypercalcemia: Borderline and chronic, with mildly elevated \nPTH in past. This degree is very unlikely to be causing \nsymptoms.    \n.  \n# Anemia: Hct 28 in baseline range.   \n.  \n# HTN:  continue lisinopril.  \n.  \n# Hyperlipidemia: continue statin   \n.  \n#: Headaches: chronic, likely related to chronic ear \ninfections\/mastoiditis.   \n.  \n# Otitis media: Right ear chronically infected.

The following day, \nheadache was relenting ___ pain. Also had fever of 102 and \ntook tylenol\/ibuprofen without relief of symptoms. He reports \nnausea and decreased PO intake. Denies vision changes, \nsensitivity to light, syncope, URI sx, chest pain, shortness of \nbreath, abd pain, diarrhea\/constipation, sick contacts. Has mild \nneck stiffness as well. He lives in ___, does a lot of\nyardwork. Has had exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, but none he \nmemorably recalls recently. No recent travel hx. No rash. He was \nfeeling entirely well prior to onset of these symptoms. Given \nterrible headache and fever, he presented to the ED. \n\nHospital Course to Date:\n\nThe pt was admitted for acute onset headache and fever. LP \nshowed a cell count of 141 with lymphocytic predominance and \nelevated protein to 100. He was initially started on bacterial \nmeningitis coverage, then narrowed to acyclovir based on \nnegative CSF stain and cultures. Doxycycline was added to cover \npotential lyme\nmeningitis. The pt's CSF came back positive for HSV PCR. Per ID \nrecommendations from ___: \"Would recommend continuing on \nAcyclovir for now but when safe for discharge can change to \nValtrex 1 gram po three times per day to complete 14 day course.\nIn setting of only low positive HSV 2 PCR and extensive outdoor \nactivity would also complete 14 day course of doxycycline even \nthough lyme is less likely.\" The pt improved dramatically. His \nheadache resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, he had no \nconfusion or neurologic deficits. He was transitioned to oral \nacyclovir the day before discharge and discharged on PO \nacyclovir + PO doxycycline for a total 14 day course.\n\nOf note, the pt was incidentally found to have an abnormally low \nHb on admission. He required 1u PRBC transfusion ___. He denies \nany known bleeding. GI was consulted and recommended EGD + \ncolonoscopy, performed ___. EGD showed diffuse erythema of \nthe mucosa with no bleeding noted in the antrum, consistent with \ngastritis. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential mass of \nmalignant appearance in the distal rectum completely encircling \nthe rectal verge. There were local ulcerations in the 12:00 \nposition. Colorectal surgery was consulted. They recommended \nfollow up at the colorectal cancer clinic. Follow up was \narranged prior to discharge and the pt was aware of the \ndiagnosis and need for follow up. The clinic and colorectal \nsurgery asked for a baseline CEA which was normal. They asked \nfor a staging MRI pelvis which did not show any spread of the \npresumed cancer. Pathology was sent by GI. Initial pathology \nshowed superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma. This was \npending at the time of discharge, though initial reports had \nshown the same diagnosis, so the pt was instructed to follow up \nwith GI. The GI phone number was shared with the patient and he \nwas instructed to call them directly if he did not hear from the \nclinic within 24 hours. The pt received a total of 2u PRBCs this \nhospitalization. Hb was 7.2 on the morning of discharge and the \npt received 1u PRBCs (the second unit this stay) on the day of \ndischarge after the Hb of 7.2 in order to ensure that his Hb did \nnot drop below 7.0 at home. Close follow up was arranged prior \nto discharge. The pt had no active bleeding at the time of \ndischarge.

After these episodes, \nshe returns to her baseline.\n\nOn this admission, she was evaluated for many causes including \ninfection; iatrogenic etiologies; PRES and vascular dementia. \n\n1) INFECTION: Ruled out for meningitis with an LP (negative for \nbacterial etiologies as well as HSV, CMV, and other viruses). \nShe received approximately 7 days of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and \naclyovir while awaiting study results, and 5 days of bactrim. \nShe also had significant pyuria but no bacteria grew on urine \nculture; however, 7d of cef\/vanc treated this possible \ndiagnosis. She had no other localizing signs or symptoms of \ninfection.\n\n2) IATROGENIC CAUSES: Though she didn't have characteristic \ntremors, her tacro was replaced by cyclosporin in case this was \ntoxicity. Several other medication changes were made, detailed \nunder transitional issues below, to minimize those that can \ncause confusion.\n\n3) POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES) and \n4) VASCULAR DEMENTIA: The patient did initially get better by \n___, but on subsequent days was more confused again, \nparticularly about higher-level functioning, such as not \nremembering how she gives herself insulin with meals. Given some \nongoing hypertension (pressures often in the 150s-170s, rarely \nas high as 180s-190s), and the relapsing-remitting presentation, \nthere was concern for PRES in the setting of immunosuppression. \nHer initial MRI was of limited utility due to artifact so a \nrepeat MRI was done on ___ which did not show evidence of PRES \nor lingering encephalitis. However, it did show microangiopathy \nand microvascular changes that could have progressed from prior \nscans -- not from most recent scan, however. \n\nCourse additionally notable for grossly normal electrolytes; EEG \nwith no seizures but intermittent right parietal slowing not \ncorrelating to findings on exam or imaging; and normal \nfolate\/B12\/TSH.\n\nThe patient was clearly improved (close to her \"real\" self, per \nher sister) at time of discharge, but still lacked some \nhigher-level functioning (not remembering how she doses insulin \nwith meals). It was not clear to us that glucose, blood pressure \ncould explain her course. Unfortunately, we did not come to a \nsatisfying diagnosis for the patient. Given what appears to be a \nstepwise decline, and her elevated blood pressures, and MRI \nfindings, we are concerned for vascular dementia, but if this \nwere to explain her previous episodes, we would expect her not \nto regain functioning in-between, and would expect worsening on \nimaging since ___. It could have been that N\/V lead to an \n___ causing transient Tacro toxicity and leading the patient to \ncommit errors in taking her medications, exacerbating confusion, \nbut this is entirely impossible to prove (and she had no ___ on \nadmission). Ultimately, we discussed with the family the need \nfor further outpatient workup and to minimize medications that \ncan contribute to confusion.\n\n# HYPERTENSION: Persistent on home medication, generally higher \nin the morning. Has been <180 except for rare exceptions, but \nregularly 150-170s. With proteinuruia that developed during \nadmission, likely not attributable to cyclosporin. Unclear if \nelevated from neuropathic pain or nausea as patient only \nintermittently endorses these. Increased amlodipine to 10mg \ndaily and ultimately held losartan due to ___. Continued \nmetoprolol. \n\n# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY and\n# PROTEINURIA in the setting of \n# ESRD s\/p LRRT: Generally maintained UOP >2L\/day. Did develop \nproteinuria on ___ (noted due periorbital edema), but this \ndowntrended. Of note, patient was switched to cyclosporine on \n___ due to concern for Tacro contribution to AMS and had an \n___ on ___ attributed to elevated cyclosporin levels, \ndowntrending by discharge. Mycophenolate and prednisone \ncontinued. There was initial concern for rejection based on \ntransplant ultrasound, but stable function and output were \nreassuring. \n\n# BRITTLE T1DM: Complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, and \nneuropathy. Insulin adjusted as per discharge medication list.\n\n# NEUROPATHY: Chronic problem for patient for which she is on \nmany medications that can contribute to altered mental status. \nHeld all of these, and she was able to tolerate. Discussed \nutility of adding back slowly and with help of a doctor to \nensure she is not more confused on any of them. \n\n# ANTICOAGULATION: Patient has a reported history of APLS, but \nthe diagnosis was not clear when Hematology was consulted in \n___. Patient prefers to be on anticoagulation per that \ndocumentation. Discussed reasoning for being on warfarin with \npatient and her sister. The 3 concerns the patient had were for \npulmonary embolism, stroke and protecting her stents. We talked \nabout the risks of bleed (which she has already had) on warfarn; \nthe role of aspirin in protecting her stents; absence of \nliterature using warfarin as empiric stroke protection in \npatients without AF (and risk of hemorrhagic conversion if \nstroke occurred); and the fact that her PE in the 1990s was \nprovoked and only required brief treatment. Though the risk of \nPE and potentially stroke are higher off of warfarin, her \nhistory of massive GI bleed and presence other modifiable risk \nfactors to reduce likelihood of stroke made discontinuing \nwarfarin a reasonable plan. We initially held warfarin in \nsetting of possibility for procedures and her INR was reversed \nfor LP; after discussing with patient we decided to continue to \nhold warfarin but touch base with outpatient providers. They \nagreed over email to the discontinuation. \n\n# NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Likely gastroparesis. Abdomen exam benign; \nLFTs and lipase normal. Per patient, had been going on for \nmonths (since pre-___). Became much less frequent while \ninpatient. Of note, family thinks this could be tied  to \nconfusion as primary neurologic cause. We discharged her with \nmetoclopramide in addition to ondansetron as PRN antiemetics. \n\n# CAD: home aspirin, atorvastatin, ranolazine, metoprolol. \nUnderwent triple angioplasty at ___ for CAD for angina in \n___. Atorvastatin dose-reduced to 10mg in setting of \ncyclosporin, which increases myopathies; it can be increased as \npatient tolerates, and she was discharged on 20mg. \n\n# PVD: Home cilostazol  \n# Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine  \n# History of GI Bleed: Home esomeprazole. \n\n# CODE: FULL (presumed)  \n# CONTACT: ___ (sister, ___  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==================\n#FOLLOW UP LABS: Please obtain Chem-10, CBC, UA, CK and \ncyclosporin levels on ___ and fax them to ___, MD, \nat the ___ Kidney ___ (FAX: ___\n#HYPERTENSION: If the patient's blood pressure is consistently \n>160\/90, please contact Dr. ___ at the Kidney \n___ @ ___\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\n-------------------\nNEUROPATHY MEDS: Gabapentin, duloxetine and vicodin all held in \nthe setting of altered mental status. The patient reported that \nher neuropathy was not bothering her significantly during \nadmission. Please consult with transplant team (specifically \ntransplant pharmacology) if patient has escalating neuropathy, \nas there may be an alternative medicine (such as pregabalin) \nthat could cause less confusion while also not interacting with \nimmunosuppression.\n#NAUSEA MEDS: Switched ondansetron for promethazine as an \nantihistamine may contribute more to confusion. Change approved \nby transplant pharmacy.\n#ANTIHYPERTENSIVES: \n-AMLODIPINE increased from 2.5mg BID to 10mg daily\n-LOSARTAN discontinued due to ___\n-METOPROLOL continued\n#ANTICOAGULATION: As described above, long conversation with \npatient and sister (HCP ___ resulted in holding Warfarin. She \nwas reversed with Vitamin K for her LP, so last day of \ntherapeutic coverage wasa ___. \n#ATORVASTATIN: lowered dose from 40mg to 10mg per day because of \nincreased myopathy risk in cyclosporine. She tolerated 10mg for \nseveral days and was increased to 20mg on day of discharge. Okay \nto increase back to 40mg if patient tolerates it without side \neffects. \n#RANITIDINE: This was held after confirming with GI Dr. ___ \n___. Concerned that large dose could contribute to patient's \nconfusion.\n#PRAMIPEXOLE: Held in setting ___ and not restarted due to \nnausea and headaches (presenting complaints) being side effect, \nand patient having significant restless leg syndrome during \ninpatient stay.\n\nOf note, she was stable and without worsened neuropathy, \nheadache or nausea for several days on this altered regimen \nprior to discharge.\n\nFOLLOW UP\n----------\n- Patient should see Dr. ___ about possible \ndiagnosis of vascular dementia vs. other etiologies for \nrecurrent\/worsening confusion.\n- MRI showed \"T1 hyperintense focus of the right thalamus on \nsagittal T1 sequence without correlate of signal abnormality on \nother sequences.  This is presumably artifactual in nature,\" but \nCT could be obtained to compare. \n- Hematology: Per ___ inpatient hematology note, patient \nshould follow up in ___ clinic for possible APLS, though doees \nnot appear from this documentation and concurrent labs that this \npatient carries this diagnosis. Conversation with patient about \nanticoagulation documented above.

You were very confused, and your family was worried about you Many CT scan pictures of your head ruled out stroke or big problems in your brain. A lumbar puncture (LP) was negative for any bacterial infection. Studies sent off for infections caused by viruses were also negative. 7 days of antibiotics were given while waiting for these results. 7 days of antibiotics were given to treat a possible urinary tract infection, though your urine never grew bacteria. Many of the medicines you were on could cause confusion, so we stopped the ones we thought it was safe to stop. Your kidney transplant medicine, Tacrolimus, was switched to another called Cyclosporin. An MRI of the brain ruled out certain reasons for your confusion, but did show evidence of possible tiny strokes. Your blood pressure was very high, so your antihypertensive medicine was adjusted. Your sugars were low at first when you weren't eating, and then were very high, so your insulin was adjusted. We talked about stopping your coumadin\/warfarn because it is a dangerous medicine and you do not have a strong reason to be on it. Your creatinine went up, which we think was due to too much cyclosporin. This medicine was reduced. You got much better, but weren't 100% back to your normal self. We talked about the importance of following up with your outpatient team."}

There is minimal increased density \nprojecting over the cardiac sillouette on the lateral view. \nElsewhere, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette \nis normal. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Loss of the right heart border with subtle increased \nright lower lung opacity which could represent right middle lobe \npneumonia. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ F h\/o DMI diagnosed at age ___ with no prior h\/o DKA, \nhypothyroidism, epilepsy, HLD, anxiety who presents with nausea, \nvomiting and hyperglycemia.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\n#) Hyperglycemia: Likely DKA given blood sugars elevated to the \n300s and h\/o DMI, with evidence of ketonuria. Precipitant \nunclear; most likely due to malfunctioning pump. Other possible \nprecipitants included infection such as viral gastroenteritis or \npneumonia. Initial AG was 24. She was treated with insulin drip \nand her gap closed.  She was transitioned to BID Lantus and \nHumalog sliding scale insulin. She was seen by ___ who \nprovided recommendations for insulin titration. She was also \nseen by a diabetes nurse educator who provided recommendations \nto transition the patient back onto her pump prior to discharge. \nShe was transiently hyperglycemic on the night prior to \ndischarge, as expected given her transition from glargine and \nhumalog injections back onto her pump and received a correction \nbolus. She is discharged home with ketone strips and will follow \nup in the ___ clinic 2 days after discharge on ___.\n\n#) Leukocytosis: Differential diagnosis included infection \nversus hemoconcentration.  Infection could be viral \ngastroenteritis based on abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting \n(though these symptoms could be a manifestation of DKA rather \nthan precipitant). CXR revealed impressive obscuration of right \nheart border, which may represent aspiration pneumonia versus \npneumonitis in the setting of nausea\/vomiting.  She did not have \nSOB or cough to suggest typical or atypical PNA. She did not \nhave dysuria to suggest UTI. Considered influenza given reported \nmyalgias, generalized weakness and subjective fever, though \npatients illness began with abrupt onset GI distress making flu \nless likely.  Leukocytosis may be a reflection of \nhemoconcentration to some extent given elevated albumin and \nHgb\/Hct approaching upper range of normal with significant \ndecrease in all cell lines after receiving IVF fluids. She was \nstarted on azithro\/CTX for five-day course and then transitioned \nto azithro monotherapy. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n\n#) Hypothyroidism:  Continued home levothyroxine.\n\n#) Epilepsy: Continued home lamotrigine.\n\n#) HLD: Continued home simvastatin.\n\n#) Anxiety: Continued home alprazolam.

Findings \nare indicative of acute infarct. The chronic left pontine \ninfarct is \nidentified. Several prominent perivascular spaces are seen in \nthe basal \nganglia region. Small right subcortical frontal infarct is also \nidentified \nwhich appears acute given the slow diffusion. Mild changes of \nsmall vessel \ndisease are seen. There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Acute right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct \ninvolving \nthe predominant in the periventricular region. Small acute right \nposterior \nfrontal subcortical infarct. Chronic left pontine infarct. Mild \nchanges of \nsmall vessel disease. \n  \nMRA OF THE NECK: \n  \nNeck MRA demonstrates normal flow in both carotid and right \nvertebral \narteries.

She \nhad an otherwise normal neuro exam, but given her history of \nprior stroke and vascular risk factors, she received a brain MRI \nand MRA of the head and neck, which showed 2 small infarcts in \nthe right lenticulostriate area and right frontal subcortical \narea. These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. \nHer MRA was unrevealing.  Her bloodwork revealed elevated \nlipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty \nacids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in \nthe past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly \nelevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the \nleast, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her \ndiet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. \nBecause she became angry when told of the possibilty of \ndiabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were \ndiscussed with both her son and daughter.

No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild (non-obstructive) \nfocal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular \ncavity size is top normal\/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nnormal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no \nvalvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is \nlikely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic \nregurgitation. At least moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is \nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or \nvegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be \ndetermined. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There \nare no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe degree of AR is similar. The aortic root has slightly \nincreased in size. There is now a very small pericardial \neffusion.

No \ndense consolidative opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax \nidentified on single view.  Right-sided chest port is seen with \ntip likely terminating over the right atrium.  A left-sided \npacemaker is seen. Mild cardiomegaly appears similar. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nNo definite acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n\nTTE ___:\n==========\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global \nsystolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical \nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully \nexcluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. \nThe aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral \nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Trivial pericardial \neffusion. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. \nMildly dilated aortic sinus. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower\/normal.  \n\nCARDIAC PERFUSION ___:\n========================\nSUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: \nFor pharmacologic stress 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg\/ml) was \ninfused \nintravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. \n  \nFINDINGS:  Computer calculated end-diastolic volume is \nborderline at 114 cc, however, left ventricular cavity size \nvisually appears normal. \n  \nRest and stress perfusion images again reveal a small inferior \nfixed defect, likely secondary to attenuation artifact.  \nOtherwise, there is uniform tracer uptake throughout the left \nventricular myocardium. \n  \nGated images reveal normal wall motion. \n  \nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 62 %. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. \n  \nSTRESS TEST ___:\n==================\nINTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of \nhypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease \n(s\/p LAD PCI ___, referred as an inpatient for the evaluation \nof chest pain after serial negative cardiac biomarkers. He \nunderwent pharmacologic vasodilator perfusion study with \n0.4mg\/5ml of regadenason over 20 seconds prior to tracer \ninjection. There was no report of any chest, back, arm, jaw, or \nneck discomfort throughout the study. There were no significant \nSTTW changes. The vasodilator effect was reversed with 125mg of \naminophylline IV. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with \noccasional ventricular paced beats and no ectopy. There was an \nappropriate hemodynamic response to regadenason. \n\nIMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes. \nNuclear \nreport sent separately. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPATIENT SUMMARY:\n================\n___ male with PMH of CAD s\/p drug-eluting stent in ___, \nsick sinus syndrome status post pacemaker in ___, paroxysmal \natrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, and CLL who \npresented with midsternal chest pain and\ndiffuse ST-segment elevations consistent with pericarditis. \n\n#CORONARIES: Mid LAD stent  \n#PUMP: >55%  \n#RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  \n\nACUTE ISSUES: \n============\n\n#CHEST PAIN\n#PERICARDITIS\nPatient presented with ___ mid-sternal chest pain.  Patient's \ntroponins were negative X4 and d-dimer also negative which \nprovided reassurance of non-ACS and non-PE event. Recreation of \npatient's chest\npain with palpation of his chest wall was initially thought to \nbe most consistent with a costochondritis.  However, EKG \nobtained upon admission showed diffuse ST elevations consistent \nwith pericarditis and the patient was treated empirically for \npericarditis. TTE showed a trivial pericardial effusion and \npreserved global left ventricular systolic function with a \nmildly dilated aortic sinus. As the patient was unable to \nreceive NSAIDs due to known CAD and questionable GI bleed on \nlast admission, he was started on colchicine and prednisone. \nThis combination improved his chest pain overall, though he \ncontinued to have occasional episodes of midsternal pain leading \nup to discharge. These episodes were all self-limiting and were \nnot associated with any new EKG changes or troponin elevations.  \nThe patient underwent a stress test to ensure no ischemic \ndisease. He had no anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes \nduring the pharmacological stress and myocardial perfusion was \nnormal. The patient will be discharged on colchicine (0.6 mg \nBID) and a prednisone taper.\n\n___\nPatient's creatinine bumped from 1.1 on admission to 2.2 on \n___. Patient had been NPO prior to myocardial perfusion study \nand the etiology of the ___ was thought to be pre-renal. This \nwas supported by urine electrolytes studies which revealed a \nurine Na < 20 and urine Cl also < 20, consistent with sodium \navid state. The patient was treated with a 1.5 liter fluid bolus \nand his creatinine rapidly downtrended. The patient's creatinine \nwas 1.2 on discharge. \n\n#DM\nPatient's blood sugars were monitored closely during this \nadmission. He initially was very poorly controlled with blood \nsugars in the mid ___. This was likely due to a delay in \nrestarting his home dose of Lantus 75 units BID (he had been \ninitially placed on 50 units BID). Metformin was held on \nadmission and the patient was placed on a sliding scale short \nacting insulin in addition to above metformin. Given the \npatient's need for 2 weeks of prednisone therapy to treat his \npericarditis, ___ was consulted to provide input regarding \nadequate glucose control while on steroids during this time. The \n___ team recommended adding  5 units of Homolog with a \nHumalog pen before meals. This dose was deemed appropriate to \nhelp control blood sugars while on prednisone and also safe \nenough to be continued after the steroid taper has finished. \n\n#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation\nPatient in sinus rhythm upon admission. The patient's home \nmetoprolol was continued for rate control. The patient's home \nrivaroxaban was 10 mg. Unclear why patient on this dose but he \nhas been maintained on 10 mg daily since at least the end of \n___. Given the patient's normal kidney function at baseline, \nthe dose was increased to 20 mg daily prior to discharge in \norder to ensure adequate anticoagulation for atrial \nfibrillation.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n==============\n\n#CLL\nPatient presented with leukocytosis to 25.6 the setting of his \nunderlying CLL.  He takes ibrutinib as an outpatient which has \nbeen controlling his symptoms. This medication was unfortunately \nnot on formulary at ___. His wife was able to bring in his \nhome ibrutinib to take while hospitalized. Acyclovir was \ncontinued at his home dose.\n\n#CHRONIC PAIN\nPatient is taking a number of medications at home to treat \nchronic pain in the shoulders as well as in his back.  We \ncontinued all of these medications while he is in the hospital.\n\n#HYPOTHYROIDISM\nContinued home levothyroxine\n\n#INSOMNIA\nContinued home ramelteon, trazodone, ziprasidone\n\n#HLD\nContinued home atorvastatin and fenofibrate.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==================\n\nPatient hospitalized for chest pain without evidence of ischemic \ndisease. Troponin and stress test both unremarkable. EKG notable \nfor diffuse STE consistent with presumptive diagnosis of \nidiopathic acute pericarditis.

This pain became severe enough to make it difficult for you to breathe. You had laboratory tests which showed that you were not having a heart attack. You had an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. This showed that you may have inflammation of the lining around the heart (called the pericardium). You were given medications to control your pain and started on steroids to reduce the inflammation of the pericardium. You were seen by the diabetes doctor in order to better control your blood sugar while on the steroids. Your kidney's were injured while in the hospital. This was likely caused by taking off too much fluid. Your kidney function improved by the time you left the hospital.

An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) showed that your heart does not pump as hard as it should, a condition called \"systolic heart failure\". A procedure called an cardiac catheterization was performed to look at the blood vessels that supply the heart, as blockages to these arteries can cause this condition. Your cardiac catheterization showed clean blood vessels, which leads us to believe your systolic heart failure may be due to your heavy alcohol use. We have started you on several medications to protect your heart and help it beat stronger, but the most important thing you can do for this condition is to stop drinking alcohol."}

He was \nnot felt to be a good surgical candidate due to metastatic \ncancer and poor functional status. He wished to become CMO. \nVancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole were prescribed to \nimprove his abdominal pain and discomfort. \n\n# Hyponatremia, chronic: Patient presented with sodium of 118 at \noutside hospital The patient was given IV fluids until stable \nsodium level reached at 127. SIADH was thought to be a \nsignificant component of his hyponatremia, given his extensive \nmetastatic disease to his lungs.\n\n# Septicemia: Met sepsis criteria on ___.

He was started on iron supplementation.\n\n# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to metastatic liver \ninvolvement vs. EtOH use given elevated AST:ALT ratio.\n\n# Alcohol abuse: Patient reports chronic use of alcohol, \nmultiple beers and at least two shots of brandy daily. Has \ncontinued to drink despite lack of appetite prior to \nhospitalization. During his admission, he had no evidence of \nwithdrawal.\n\n# Melena: Patient had melena after stent placement. \nSigmoidoscopy on ___ showed tumor infiltration into the stent \nwith friable, bleeding tissue, which was the likely source of \nhis bleeding.\n\n# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril in the setting of low blood \npressures.\n\n# Hepatitis C: untreated.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\n=======\nMetastatic colon (adenocarcinoma) cancer\nColonic perforation\nHospital associated pneumonia\nSepticemia\n\nSecondary:\n==========\nAnemia\nHypertension\nHyponatremia\nHepatitis C\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired","summary":"He wastransferred from ___ ___ after a CT scan was concerning for colon cancer.

Brief \nhospital course by problem below.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n=============\n# IBD flare:\nIBD confirmed on CLS with biopsy (___). Began pred 40mg QD \non ___. Uptitrated to pred 60mg QD on ___ with hydrocortisone \nenema ___ I the setting of persistent disease. Presented to \n___ in setting of continued disease activity on ___ with \nsevere LLQ pain, bloody diarrhea, and non-bloody emesis.  \nImaging (MRE, CT Abd\/Pelvis, endoscopy) consistent with \nmoderate-to-severe ___ flare with no evidence of perianal \ninfection (abscess, fistula). Low suspicion for colonic perf s\/p \ncolonoscopy (no free air), pregnancy (negative test in ED), PID \n(given no CMT on ED exam or sxs) or trauma.  C diff and stool cx \nnegative. CRP downtrended appropriately over hospitalization. GI \nwas consulted for treatment recommendations. For pain, pt was \ntreated with IV tylenol to mild effect. NSAIDs and opioids were \ncontraindicated iso IBD flare. For her IBD, pt was treated with \nIV solumedrol 20mg (___).  She was also started on \ninfliximab on ___ after negative PPD, negative hepatitis A\/B\/C \nserologies, and s\/p 24h valacyclovir treatment for presumptive \nVZV reactivation.  Patient was tolerating a low residue diet \nwith no pain on discharge, denying loose bowel movement.  CRP \npeaked at 161 on ___. CRP on discharge 5.2. Discharge on PO \nprednisone 40mg with plan to taper by patient's GI.  Second \ninfliximab infusion on ___. \n\n# Hyperkalemia: \nOn ___, the patient was found to have a K of 6.0 on routine AM \nlabs. However, on re-check without fluids or other intervention \nand requesting no tourniquet, the patient's K normalized, \nsuggesting pseudohyperkalemia.

Per OB\/GYN, no need for \nemergent removal, and the patient was scheduled for outpatient \n___ on ___ at 9:45AM Chief resident clinic, ___ 8 at \n___.\n\n# Hydronephrosis:\nOn abdominal\/pelvic CT with contrast, incidental hydronephrosis \nwas found.  Per discussion with radiology, did not appear \nconsistent with obstructive uropathy secondary to \nnephrolithiasis.  No urinary complaints during hospitalization \nwith normal renal function and bland UA. ___ have passed a \nstone, but no residual evidence.  Cr remained stable over \nhospitalization.  Patient advised to seek medical care and\/or \nultrasound if develops urinary symptoms, flank pain, or nausea \nor if hydronephrosis persists.\n\n#Pain Control:\nDuring admission, opioids and NSAIDs were avoided.  Pain \nadequately controlled on IV\/PO acetaminophen.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Pt has an IUD which has invaded into the myometrium of her \nuterus and should be removed. An outpatient appointment with \nOB\/GYN has been scheduled on  ___ at 9:45AM Chief resident \nclinic, ___ 8 at ___..\n[ ] Pt has mild L-sided hydronephrosis found on CT scan which \nradiology feels is not related to a renal stone causing \nobstruction. Other causes of obstruction are possible. Pt should \nhave ultrasound in future to re-evaluate and further workup \nshould be considered if hydronephrosis is persistently present.\n[ ] Continue PO prednisone 40mg until ___.  Second infliximab \ninfusion on ___ for which patient will receive instructions from \nGI primary.  \n[ ] Consider DEXA scan for ankylosing spondylitis eval as an \noutpatient and prior to starting biologics\n[ ] Patient found to be HAV Ab negative.

We consulted our GI service, who recommended a plan for your treatment, which you received. We performed a lower GI endoscopy, which showed active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and was negative for other acute causes of your abdominal pain. We performed tests that showed no evidence of infection. We screened you for tuberculosis and hepatitis A, B, and C, all of which were negative, prior to beginning a new medication called infliximab. We gave you IV steroids, which eventually helped, but introduced infliximab to achieve better control of your IBD. We imaged your abdomen and pelvis, which incidentally showed that your IUD was incorrectly positioned. We asked our OB\/GYN service to see you for the IUD, who felt there was no need to remove it emergently. They arranged an appointment for you to have your IUD removed as an outpatient as below. We found that you had elevated potassium levels, which we believe was due to the way in which your blood was drawn. When we re-checked it, it was normal. We found a small increase in your liver enzymes, that began to normalize. This may be secondary to your new medication, of which you have 4 more days."}

Heart is mildly enlarged. Calcifications are \npresent in the aortic arch. Deviation of the trachea to the \nright is probably due to an enlarged thyroid. There are diffuse \nbilateral opacities with perihilar distribution and more \nprominent in the lower zone, consistent with moderate-to-severe \npulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also \npresent. The degree of pulmonary edema limits assessment for \nfocal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. \nIMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and moderate \nbilateral pleural effusions. \n\nEKG: Atrial fibrillation with PVCs, Rate 127, normal axis, no ST \nchanges, no TWI \n\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The estimated \nright atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). There is mild (non-obstructive) focal \nhypertrophy of the basal septum. The estimated cardiac index is \nnormal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Diastolic function could not be \nassessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion \nare normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is \nnot present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Mild mitral regurgiation. Moderate pulmonary \nhypertension. \n\nCXR ___:\nThere is volume loss\/ alveolar infiltrates in the lower lungs \nbut overall the\nappearance is much improved compared to the study from 2 days \nago. There small\nbilateral pleural effusions that are smaller compared to prior. \nThere\ncontinues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and moderate \nto severe\ncardiomegaly\nIMPRESSION: \nImprovement in fluid status both pulmonary edema persist.\n\nEKG ___:\nSinus rhythm. Occasional premature atrial contractions. Poor R \nwave\nprogression. There are biphasic T waves in the anterior leads. \nCannot\nrule out underlying myocardial ischemia. Compared to the \nprevious tracing\nof ___ biphasic anterolateral T waves are more pronounced. \nClinical\ncorrelation is suggested.\n\nMICRO:\n\nBlood Cx ___: negative\n\nURINE CULTURE (Final ___: \n      Culture workup discontinued.

She was on warfarin \nand metoprolol at home. She was started on amiodarone 200mg \ndaily in an effort to keep her into sinus rhythm. At discharge \nshe was in sinus rhythm.  \n\n# Volume overload: The patient presented with volume overload \nlikely due to flash pulmonary edema from afib. On admission she \nhad an elevated BNP, ___ edema, and findings of increased \npulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR. Echocardiogram \nshowed moderate pulm HTN, otherwise unremarkable. She received \ndiuretics with improvement in her volume status. By discharge \nshe was asymptomatic and feeling well. \n\n# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive during admission. \nOf note, her amlodipine and HCTZ were recently stopped due to \nlightheadedness and low pressures. Her lisinopril was increased \nwith better control of her pressures.

Chemical DVT ppx was \nheld at time of discharge after he was HIT positive and given \nrisk of bleeding with suction trauma.\n.\n# Respiratory distress: His respiratory distress has \ncurrentlyimproved. Post bronchoscopy, he was noted to be mildly \ntachypnic with RR ___ and was 88% on 15L NC. A CXR showed \nworsening pulmonary edema, and he received lasix with \nimprovement in PACU. He was transferred to the MICU for closer \nmonitoring. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and an \nIVF bolus prior to bronchoscopy. He is typically on 50% FIO2 \nwith his trach mask. He was weaned from the ventilator, and was \ncontinued on albuterol MDIs. He was also treated with vancomycin \nand cefepime for HCAP, until his sputum Cx grew coag-positive \nstaph sensitive to levofloxacin. He was started on an 8-day \ncourse of levofloxacin 750mg qday, of which the last dose will \nbe on ___. Lasix 40mg PO daily was restarted on day of \ndischarge. This should be titrated as needed.\n-We recommend keeping the patient on the ventilator (MMV) \novernight to decrease his work of breathing.\n.\n# Fever: The patient p\/w low grade fever\/temperature post \nbronchoscopy. His fever curve was trended, and cultures were \nsent. His urine and blood cultures showed no growth, while his \nsputum culture grew coag-positive staph as mentioned above. He \nwas continued on levofloxacin.\n.\n# Anemia: His anemia was stable after 2u pRBC prior to transfer, \nand his hematocrits remained stable. There was no further need \nfor transfusion.\n.\n# Asymetric swelling of LUE: His LUE was cooler than the RUE and \nmore swollen than the right, but still had good pulses. Although \nhis wife stated that his LUE has always been swollen, a doppler \nof the LUE was obtained which showed no evidence of DVT. The \nswelling appears to have reduced, although it still remains more \nswollen than the RUE. \n.\n# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (40-45%): The initial physical \nexam showed leg edema and his chest x-ray suggest mild CHF. He \nwas given 20mg of lasix in the PACU, and further diuresis was \nnot undertaken in the ICU. He was started on Lasix 40mg PO daily \n(Previous home dose) on day of discharge. This should continue \nto be monitored. He was given free water flushes through his G \ntube for hypernatremia, which resolved during his stay.  \n.\n# Low platelet count: His platelets fell from 273 on admission \nto 107 prior to discharge. This drop was consistent with \nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which his heparin was \ndiscontinued. This was confirmed as his heparin antibody from \n___ was positive. His PLT count on ___ is 111. He was put on \npneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis given risk of bleeding with \nsuction.\n-He should not be given heparin.\n.\n# Hypernatremia: As above, he was given free water flushes for \ncorrection of his hypernatremia, which appears to have resolved. \nFree water flushes were continued at time of discharge.\n.  \n# Oral candidiasis: PO fluconazole was stopped prior to \ndischarge.\n.\nOnly evidence of bleed is suection trauma in L maintstem \nbronchus, needs to come back in 6 week from ___ for rpt \nbronch\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 975mg PO Q8H  \ncarvedilol 3.125mg PO BID  \nCitalopram 20mg PO daily  \ndocusate 100mg PO BID  \nferrous sulfate 300mg PO daily  \nfluconazole 100mg PO Q12H  \nfolic acid 1 mg po daily  \nlasix 40mg PO daily  \ngabapentin 300mg PO Q12H  \nheparin 5000U SC Q12H  \nlisinopril 2.5mg PO daily  \nMVI daily  \nomeprazole 20mg PO daily  \nprotein supplement daily  \nalbuterol inhaler 4 puffs Q2H prn wheezing  \nsimethicone 80mg PO Q8Hprn  \noxycodone ___ po q4h prn  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every \neight (8) hours as needed for pain.  \n2. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every \neight (8) hours as needed for pain.  \n3. carvedilol 3.125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n4. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n5. docusate sodium 50 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) milliliters \nPO BID (2 times a day).  \n6. ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO once a day.  \n7. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n8.

An element of muscle spasm was \nalso thought to be likely, based on his symptoms. He was given \nmorphine and Percocet initially for pain control. He was \ntransitioned to Percocet only, and low-dose Flexiril was added \nto aid with control of muscle spasm, as well as heat to the \narea. His symptoms continued to be significant and limiting to \nhis progress with physical therapy. The Chronic Pain Service was \nconsulted, and recommended a new medication regimen. He was \ngiven Toradol x 2 doses, and started on standing Tylenol, \ngabapentin, and tizanidine as well as oxycodone as needed. The \nfollowing morning his symptoms had improved, and he was able to \ntransition more easily in and out of bed. He was transferred to \na rehabilitation facility for extended physical therapy. \n.  \n*)Atrial fibrillation: also with a history of complete heart \nblock with a pacemaker, rate-controlled on admission. His INR \nwas found to be supra-therapeutic at 4.4, and his Coumadin was \nheld for one day. On re-check, his INR continued to increase, so \nhis Coumadin was stopped. Metoprolol was continued during his \nhospitalization. His INR will need to be followed, and Coumadin \nre-started once INR is less than 3. \n.\n*)Elevated creatinine: his creatinine was at his baseline at 1.1 \non admission, with an increase to 1.3 after he received Toradol. \nThis will need to be followed up with repeat labs; he did not \nreceive any additional NSAIDs and was not discharged on any. On \nthe day of discharge his creatinine had begun to trend back \ndown.\n.  \n*)Hypertension: BP was well-controlled on his home medication \nregimen.  \n.  \n*)Chronic diastolic heart failure: felt to be at baseline on \nadmission. His home medication was continued.  \n.  \n*)BPH: finasteride and Flomax were continued during his \nhospitalization.\n.\n*)Hyponatremia: stable at baseline. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n- eplerenone 25mg every other day  \n- finasteride 5mg daily  \n- Lasix 20mg daily  \n- Latanoprost 0.0005%  \n- meclizine 12.5mg as needed  \n- metoprolol 50mg twice daily  \n- Flomax 0.4 twice daily  \n- Valsartan 320mg daily  \n- Coumadin as directed ___  \n- aspirin 81mg daily  \n- coenzyme Q10  \n- vitamin D 400mg daily  \n- folic acid  \n- glucosamine 750mg daily  \n- multivitamin  \n- niacin 400mg daily  \n- omega 3 fatty acid  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Also, metastatic \nlesion within the T7 vertebral body has increased in size.  \nThere is new enhancing anterior and posterior epidural \nmetastatic disease from T10 through L1 levels. \n  \nThere is stable extensive metastatic disease within the lumbar \nspine and \npelvis as described above. \n  \nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo man history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic \nlow back pain, renal cell carcinoma s\/p metastases to lumbar \nspine, sacrum, right iliac wing s\/p XRT and chemotherapy \n(sutent) admitted with worsened low back pain. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n-------------\n# Low back pain: Mr. ___ was admitted with acute on chronic \nlow back pain.  He has known extensive renal cell carcinoma \nmetastases to lumbar spine, T2, and T7.  MRI on this admission \nshowed steady progression of the thoracic mets, particularly \nwith T2 collapse and epidural extension.  Given concern for T2 \nvertebra stability, neurosurgery was consulted and recommended \nthat he have a full TLS (Somi) brace at all times while upright. \n He, however, is not required to wear the brace when lying down \nat HOB <30 degs.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough \nthat significant neck movement is prohibited.  The brace is \ndesigned to restrict neck movement - and thus precludes Mr. \n___ from driving.  With his interests in driving and his \ncollection of multiple cars\/trucks, this news was naturally \nquite distressing to Mr. ___.  Social Work was consulted to \nprovide some coping.  It was communicated to Mr. ___ that it \nis unlikely that he will be able to drive ever again.  He would \nnot be able to drive with the brace because of neck \nrestrictions; he would not be able to drive without it because \nthe risk of paralysis with T2 vertebra instability; and patient \nis already at significant risk with the high doses of opiates \nand pain medications.  During this stay, here, there was no \ncauda equina symptoms.  Pain was controlled with dexamethasone, \nButrans patch, tramadol, NSAIDs, cyclobenzaprine, oxycodone PRN. \n The Butrans patch was doubled to 20 ug\/hr to provide stronger \nbaseline relief of the pain.  ___ evaluated the patient and felt \nhe was stable for discharge but would benefit from home physical \ntherapy.  Training on the placement on removal of the brace was \nprovided to the patient and his wife.  The ___ was \ncontacted with paperwork stating that the patient is not \nmedically safe to drive.  The patient refused to sign this \npaperwork. \n\n# Renal cell carcinoma: s\/p XRT and chemotherapy (Sutent).  Mr. \n___ has been off the Sutent due to significant mucositis and \nnausea.  There has been near complete resolution of these \nsymptoms.  There is some residual sacral wounds and wound \nconsult made the following recommendations: Mepilex to back \nblisters to protect from friction from straps, Criticaid clear \nto perianal fissures Qshifts or pRN, pressure redistribution \nmeasures, limit sit time to 1 hour at a time.  He will follow \nwith Dr. ___ to determine what chemo to \ninitiate as an outpt\n\n# Anemia: Mr. ___ has had decrease in Hct but no clear \nevidence of bleed.  There was no GI bleed noted and blood \npressure was stable.  Hematocrit was followed serially. \n\n# Hiccups: patient was started on a trial of chlorpromazine 25mg \nTID x 7 days, which he will continue upon discharge\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Hypertension: stable, patient was continued on atenolol and \nhydrochlorthiazide.\n\n# GERD: patient was continued on home omeprazole.\n\n# Anxiety: no anxiolytics were provided while patient was \nadmitted.\n.\nTRANSITIONS OF CARE\n-------------------\n# Follow-up: patient will follow up with Oncology on discharge, \nfor an appointment to be arranged after discharge.  He will be \ndischarged with a Somi brace and wheelchair.  He should have a \nfull TLS (Somi) brace on at all times while upright.  He, \nhowever, is not required to wear the brace when lying down at \nHOB <30 degrees.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough \nthat significant neck movement is prohibited.  He will get home \nphysical therapy.\n\n# Code status: patient is confirmed full code.\n\n# Contact: Wife ___ ___\n\n \n___ on Admission:\n- ATENOLOL 25 mg daily\n- Butrans 10 mcg\/hour Transderm Patch. 10 mg patch once weekly\n- COLCHICINE 0.6 mg tablet. 1 tablet daily \n- CYCLOBENZAPRINE 10 mg tablet QHS PRN restless legs\n- DEXAMETHASONE 4 mg BID\n- HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25 mg daily \n- LORAZEPAM 0.5 mg PRN \n- OMEPRAZOLE ___ 20 mg Daily\n- ONDANSETRON HCL Dosage uncertain\n- OXYCODONE ___ mg q4h PRN pain\n- PROCHLORPERAZINE MALEATE ___ mg QID PRN nausea\n- SUNITINIB [SUTENT] 12.5 mg 3 capsule mouth daily x 2 weeks, \nthen 1 week off.\n- TRAMADOL - tramadol 150 mg daily \n- ASPIRIN 325 mg daily\n- NAPROXEN SODIUM [ALEVE] 220 mg PRN\n- TROLAMINE SALICYLATE [ASPERCREME] - Dosage uncertain -  (OTC)\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

As you know, you were admitted with increased pain in the back. MRI of the spine showed progression of the cancer involvement of the T2 and T7 vertebrae. The T2 vertebra (below the neck), in particular, was collapsed and revealed extension of the break into the spinal canal. It is for this reason, that you should have the brace in place while you are upright. This can be removed when you are lying down flat with the head below 30 degrees from horizontal. You have verbalized that you understand the risks and potential consequences, namely paralysis, that can occur from not wearing the brace. Because of the limitations with the neck brace, you should not drive for risk of getting into an accident. Driving without the brace is equally dangerous, as the T2 vertebra may press on the spinal cord and lead to paralysis - and thus a risk for yourself and others. The ___ ___ has been contacted and your license is no longer active and you are not permitted by law to be driving."}

We did tests that showed you were having a heart attack. You underwent a procedure called a cardiac catheterization which showed a blockage in one of the vessels that brings blood to your heart which was the cause of your heart attack. A stent was placed to keep the blood vessel open. Your hospital course was complicated by a slow heart rate which is often seen after the type of heart attack you had. We started you on medications called blood thinners to prevent the stent placed in your heart from getting clogged. It is very important that you take this medicine every day. We also gave you medicines to prevent another heart attack."}

The heart size is normal. \nThe mediastinal contours are unchanged, including leftward \ndeviation of the trachea at the level of the clavicular heads, \nraising suspicion for right thyroid enlargement. There are no \npleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Bibasilar reticulonodular opacities, slightly decreased on \nthe right and increased on the left compared to prior radiograph \nfrom ___, concerning for a multifocal infectious \nprocess.\n2. Persistent rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of \nthe clavicular heads, raising concern for right thyroid \nenlargement. If not already performed, a non-emergent thyroid \nultrasound could provide further information.\n\n___ CTA CHEST\n  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental \nlevels bilaterally. Scattered aortic calcifications are seen. \nThe heart is grossly unremarkable aside from left atrial \nenlargement. Dense coronary artery calcifications are seen. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. There are no pathologically \nenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or axillae. \nExtending from the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the \nthyroid, there is a 3.2 x 3.0 cm hypodense nodule, causing mild \nleftward shift of the trachea at this level (2:8).\n  There are ground glass and more consolidative opacities along \nthe dependent aspects of both lower lobes, possibly atelectasis, \nalthough aspiration pneumonitis should also be considered, \nespecially given the presence of high-density material within \nthis region that likely represents previously aspirated oral \ncontrast material. Within the left upper lobe, there is a 9-mm \nground glass nodule (2:31). Additionally, there is a 2-mm right \nupper lobe nodule (2:28). The airways are patent to the \nsubsegmental levels bilaterally. There is a trace left pleural \neffusion.\n  This study was not optimized for evaluation of the \nintra-abdominal contents. Minimal central pneumobilia is not \nsignificantly changed compared to CT from ___ \n(2:55-56).\nBONE WINDOW: There is diffuse dimineralziation. Within the \ndistal right clavicle, there is a 12 x 11 mm sclerotic lesion \n(2:10). Additionally, within the posterior right seventh rib, \nthere is a 5-mm sclerotic lesion (2:30). Multilevel degenerative \nchanges of the thoracic spine are noted. There is also \nossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n2. Bilateral lower lobe ground glass and consolidative \nopacities, raising concern for aspiration pneumonitis in the \nappropriate setting, although atelectasis could also explain \nthis finding. Punctate hyperdense foci in the dependent portions \nof the lower lobes suggest there may have been prior aspiration.\n3. 12-mm sclerotic focus in the distal right clavicle and 5-mm \nsclerotic focus in the posterior right seventh rib are \nnonspecific, but blastic metastases are not entirely excluded \ngiven the history of prostate cancer. Correlation with a bone \nscan could provide further information if PSA is sufficiently \nelevated to suggest any substantial probability of bone \nmetastases.\n4. 9-mm left upper lobe ground glass pulmonary nodule should be \nfurther  evaluated with CT in three months; an additional 2-mm \nright upper lobe nodule could be reassessed on the same followup \nstudy, noting the history of malignancy.\n5. 3.2-cm right thyroid nodule could be further evaluated with \nnon-emergent thyroid ultrasound, unless this has previously been \nperformed.\n\n___ ADENOSINE STRESS ECHO\n70 and 140mcg\/kg\/min of Adenosine was was infused intravenously \nfor 4.5 minutes. Infusion was terminated due to rapidly \nprogressive chest and throat discomfort in the setting of a \nbrief period of second degree AV block. AV block resolved \nfollowing termination of the infusion. Symptoms resolved 1 min \npost-infusion. No significant ST changes were noted.  \nINTERPRETATION: \nLeft ventricular cavity size is severely enlarged. \nRest and stress perfusion images reveal a severe inferolateral \nfixed perfusion defect and moderate inferior and anterolateral \nfixed perfusion defects. Gated images reveal global hypokinesis. \nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 25%.\nCompared with the study of ___ the fixed inferior wall \ndefect is worse and the inferolateral and anterolateral fixed \ndefects are new. There has also been mark reduction in left \nventricular ejection fraction as well as severe enlargement in \nLV cavity size.\nIMPRESSION: \n1. New severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral fixed \ndefects. Moderate inferior wall fixed defect, worse since ___.\n2. Global hypokinesis with marked reduction in left ventricular \nejection fraction since most recent prior study. EF 25%.\n3. Severely enlarged left ventricular cavity size since prior \nstudy.\n\n___ L HIP XRAY\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in \nthe appearance of the hemiarthroplasty, which remains well \nseated and without evidence of acute hardware-related \ncomplication.\n\n___ LLE DOPPLER ULTRASOUND\nDuplex evaluation was performed on the left lower extremity \nveins.  There is normal compression and augmentation of the \ncommon femoral, proximal femoral, mid femoral, distal femoral, \npopliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins. There is normal \nphasicity of the common femoral vein bilaterally.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with complicated PMH notable for CAD s\/p multiple PCI, \nsystolic CHF (LVEF 35% in ___, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, \ntype II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer, and \nrecent admission for stabilization of atraumatic left femur \nfracture, now re-admitted from rehab for exertional angina \nduring physical therapy.\n\n# Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: Patient \nreadmitted with anginal chest pain, brought on by exertion & \nrelieved with nitroglycerin. ECG without evidence of acute \nischemia\/infarction, but serial cardiac biomarkers showed mild \nnew elevation in troponin-T peaking 2 days after chest pain \nepisode. He was started on long-acting nitrate (Imdur 30 mg \ndaily). He did have one chest pain episode in-house which \nresolved with 1 tab SL TNG. He underwent adenosine nuclear \nstress test (H\/O intolerance to both Persantine and dobutamine), \nwhich showed new severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral \nfixed defects, interval worsening moderate inferior wall fixed \ndefect, and global hypokinesis LVEF decreased to 25% (from 35% \nin ___. Given the absence of objective evidence of a large \narea of ischemia (rather than prior infarct, as documented) and \nthe small troponin elevation, conservative medical therapy was \npursued rather than invasive risk stratification with coronary \nangiography. He was continued on his home medications: aspirin, \nmetoprolol (at recently increased dose), Lipitor, dabigatran. \nPlavix was not started given bleeding risk (H\/O radiation \nproctitis plus admission 6 mos ago for BRBPR).\n\n# Chronic systolic heart failure with acute diastolic \nexacerbation, LVEF 25%: Last TTE in ___ demonstrated moderate \nregional LV systolic dysfunction  with inferior and \ninferolateral hypokinesis. Pharmacological MIBI showed interval \nworsening heart failure, LVEF decreased to 25% with increase LV \ncavity size, all likely due to silent infarcts at home during \nthe intervening ___ years, since MIBI also showed extension of \nprior infarcts and new infarcts in an LAD distribution. During \nthis admission, he appeared euvolemic for several days, with no \nevidence ___ or pulmonary edema. He then developed asymmetric \n___ edema after receiving small amount IVF on ___ (asymmetry \nlikely due to recent left hip surgery, ___ negative for DVT). \nThis ___ edema was likely dependent edema after being up to a \nchair for many hours. The patient should have his legs elevated \nwhile in bed or sitting in chair and should wear compression \nstockings. He was continued on home metoprolol. We note that he \nis not on Lasix or an ACE-I (despite his diabetes and CAD); \nstarting ACE-I as an outpatient should be considered once renal \nfunction normalizes (as BP tolerates).\n\n# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On Pradaxa for anticoagulation \nplus metoprolol for rate control, which were continued. HR \ntrended ___, no episodes RVR.\n\n# Recent aspiration pneumonia: On admission, patient was midway \nthrough a treatment course of levofloxacin for presumed \naspiration pneumonia, which he completed on ___. CTA chest \nshowed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for \naspiration pneumonitis. Patient gave history of feeling he was \nswallowing his own saliva. Speech and swallow service performed \nbedside evaluation, suggested patient's diet be restricted to \nnectar-thickened liquids, soft solids, and pills crushed in \napplesauce. They also recommended video swallow, which we \nrequested to be performed in rehab.\n\n# Chronic kidney disease: Patient has H\/O chronic kidney \ndisease; review of ___ years of creatinine levels show baseline \n1.2 - 1.5. Cr was 1.1 on admission; rose to 1.3 by the follow \nmorning (likely due to contrast load received for CTA chest), \nthen normalized thereafter but worsened in the setting of volume \noverload. Urine lytes showed low urine Na, which could be due to \neither pre-renal physiology and\/or worsening congestive heart \nfailure, as above.\n\n# S\/P left femoral hemi-arthroplasty: Patient had been \ndischarged to rehab for <24 hours. He had previously been \nhospitalized on the medicine service where he underwent left \nhemiarthroplasty by ortho for atraumatic (suspected pathologic) \nleft femur fracture, concerning for possible involvement of \ntreated prostate cancer -- pathology returned negative. He \nworked with ___ during this admission. Ortho follow-up discharge \nappointments arranged (see below). Patient had repeat hip X-ray \nhere, which was unchanged from prior, no acute fracture.\n\n# Incidental Chest CT Finding: Bilateral lung nodules, sclerotic \nlesions rib and clavicle: Findings noted on CTA chest obtained \non admission. Concerning for possible metastic disease, \nespecially given recent atraumatic left femur fracture. Lung \nnodules need surveillance imaging in 3 months. Patient was \nre-scheduled for heme-onc follow-up including review of \npathology from recent intra-operative left femur bone biopsy \nobtained during last admission.\n\n# Depression\/Grief: Patient noted to be suffering from \ndepression and grief over his wife's recently-diagnosed terminal \npancreatic cancer. Social work followed during this admission. \nPsychiatry consulted for repeated expressions of passive \nsuicidality to nursing staff; they felt patient was suffering \nsignificantly but was not an imminent threat to himself. Both \npsychiatry and social work recommended ongoing therapy, which \npatient accepted only after significant encouragement but seemed \nto appreciate. He was not interested in pharmacotherapy. Ongoing \ntherapy at rehab and beyond was recommended for coping with his \ngrief.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Angina - monitor for symptoms, use of SL NG, consider \nlong-acting nitrate dose increase to 60 mg as BP tolerates.\n2. CHF - Patient not on ACE-I on admission, none started given \nacute renal failure but should be revisited in cardiology \nfollow-up.\n3. RECENT LEFT HIP ARTHROPLASTY- has ortho f\/u wwith films. \nPatient concerned about \"clicking sounds\" but left hip films \nhere unchanged. Please discuss with patient what to expect in \nterms of rehabilitation, functional status & timeline.\n4. HEME\/ONC - follow-up imaging findings demonstrating chest \nwall lytic\/sclerotic lesions, as well as bilateral lung nodules. \n___ need further onc follow-up given hx of prostate cancer.\n5. GRIEF\/DEPRESSION - ongoing difficulties coping with his own & \nwife's medical diagnoses. Needs therapist and\/or pharmacologic \nmanagement. \n6. SUSPECTED OSTEOPOROSIS (per last discharge summary) - Patient \nneeds review of possible osteoporosis and initiation of \nbisphosphonate; Ca\/Vitamin D already started.\n7.

No clear\netiology for her symptoms was identified: TSH was normal,\naldosterone level was normal but renin moderately low and the\nratio was 171. This ratio was noted to be elevated in the lab\nresult and her PCP commented that addition of spironolactone did\nnot help. In addition, a CT AP was done at that time that was\nunrevealing for a visible adrenal adenoma to explain the\naldosterone level. She had a renal US that showed unilateral 60%\nstenosis. Her cardiologist and PCP did not believe these \nfindings\nto be enough to explain her symptoms.

She has experienced 5 episodes in\nthe past 2 months and has gone to the hospital each time. It is\nnot associated with any other precipitating factors. Most likely\ndue to moderate-severe AS (mean aortic gradient 41mmHg and ___\n.7cm2 found on TTE on ___. Endocrine factors contributing to\nlightheadedness have been ruled out with normal thyroid (x2 TSH)\nand normal aldosterone levels. Neurologic etiology less likely\ngiven negative MRA\/MRI at ___ and arrhythmias less likely\ngiven none noted on any of her previous admissions.\n\n#Severe aortic stenosis\nWorsening AS found on TTE in ___ compared to ___ of this\nyear, as well as more frequent symptoms.

TSH was normal, and aldosterone level was\nnormal but renin moderately low (ratio 171), consistent with\nsecondary hyperaldosteronism. CT showed adrenal adenoma to\nexplain the aldosterone level. Renal U\/S showed 60% renal artery\nstenosis on right, possibly due to AS and peripheral\nvasoconstiction. Pheochromocytoma was thought to be unlikely so\nurine metanephrines were not sent.

The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global systolic \nfunction (biplane LVEF = 60%). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly \ndilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation \nis seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. \nMild aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nregional and global left ventricular systolic function is much \nimproved. \n\n___ LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION: Coronary angiography:  \nright dominant\nLMCA: Normal\nLAD: Very tortuous with prominent intramyocardial bridge.  There\nis systolic compression but not diastolic compression.   There \nis\na very large diagonal diagonal branch without stenosis. \nLCX: The LCx was a large vessel.   There was a large OMB1 \nwithout\ndisease.  The LCx terminated in a large vessel with prominent\nleft posterolateral branches.  There was no disease within the\nLCx or its posterolateral branches.  \nRCA: The RCA was a dominant vessel with a large PDA and smaller\nright posterolateral branch.    The RCA was free of disease. \nASSESSMENT\n1. Insignificant coronary artery disease with a prominent\nintramyocardial bridge.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with HTN, COPD (2L home O2), with recent admission for \nhypoxic respiratory failure with course complicated by new-onset \ncardiomyopathy thought to be stress-induced, referred from her \nPCP's office with ECG changes and chest pain. EKG with diffuse \nTWI in V2-V6 and patient had epigastric pain, severe, but \nsimilar to her ___ pain. She had bilateral lower \nextremity edema and her proBNP was elevated (but lower than \nduring her hospitalization). She responded well to Lasix 40mg IV \nx 1. Her trops were negative and once she got to the floor her \nEKG changes actually resolved. Heart catheterization on ___ \nrevealed no significant CAD, but presence of an intramyocardial \nbridge over the LAD. Her chest pain and EKG changes likely due \nto coronary vs esophageal vasopasm. We started Imdur 30mg daily \non admission, but this was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed \nthat her EF normalized (60%). Her dilitiazem (discontinued on \nlast admission) was restarted on discharge. \n\n# ECG Changes \/ Diffuse TWI\nHer ECG findings are most likely secondary to coronary and\/or \nesophageal vasospasm. The patient's pain resolved with morphine \nand had three negative troponins. EKG changes resolved once \npatient arrived on floor. Imdur 30 mg was added initially for \nthe pain and ECG changes. Cardiac catheterization on ___ \nshowed no significant coronary artery disease but myocardial \nbridge of LAD. Imdur was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed \nthat her EF normalized (60%) and her dilitiazem (discontinued on \nlast admission) was restarted on discharge.  \n\n# Stress-induced cardiomyopathy\nPatient recently discharged with new EF reduction to 35%, \nthought to be most consistent with a stress-induced \ncardiomyopathy. The patient had continued the regimen on which \nshe was recently discharged, including furosemide 20mg daily. \nShe appeared volume overloaded on admission and received IV \nlasix x1. She was trialed on 40 mg PO lasix daily, however, due \nto hypotension, this was reduced to prior dose of 20 mg daily. \nDue to distribution of T-wave changes on EKG, it was thought \nthat her cardiomyopathy may have been ischemic. Cardiac \ncatheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary \nartery disease but intramyocardial bridge over LAD. Repeat TTE \non ___ showed normalization of her EF to 60%. She continued \nhome aspirin and losartan, but metoprolol was discontinued. \nPrevious home diltiazem was restarted on discharge due to normal \nEF. She was kept on 20 mg furosemide daily, as she likely has \ncomponent of diastolic heart failure. She did not appear volume \noverloaded on discharge.\n\n# GERD \/ ___ Esophagus \nLast EGD ___ with diffuse gastritis and evidence of \n___. Symptoms on admission were suggestive of esophageal \nvasospasm, which may account for diffuse TWI. She continued home \nPPI and was started on imdur 30 mg daily, but this was \ndiscontinued on discharge. Home diltiazem (discontinued on \nprevious admission due to depressed EF) was restarted on \ndischarge after TTE revealed normalization of EF to 60%.\n\n# Hyponatremia  \nChronic based on her labs, and at her baseline around 131. Has \nbeen previously attributed to SIADH which was again considered \nduring her last hospitalization as her sodium saw no improvement \nwith either fluid administration or diuresis. Sodium remained \nstable.  \n\n# Hypertension  \nHistory of hypertension, previously on diltiazem. This was \ndiscontinued after her last hospitalization. She continued her \nhome losartan. Diltiazem restarted on discharge.\n\n# COPD: On home O2 since prior hospitalization. Long term \nsmoker. She was started on tiotropium on day of discharge for \npresumed COPD. She reported that she has outpatient PFTs \nscheduled.\n\n# Anemia, normocytic: Patient with history of normocytic anemia \nsince ___, with baseline HCT between ___. She was \npreviously anemic in ___, but had normal H\/H most recently \nin ___. Iron studies during this admission were suggestive \nof anemia of chronic inflammation.\n\n# Bladder Spasm: She continued home oxybutynin.  \n\n# Right hip pain  \nThought to be due to known spinal stenosis and chronic right hip \n \npain. She continued home acetaminophen, lidocaine patches.  \n\nTransitional Issues:\n====================\n- patient started on tiotropium for possible COPD; needs \noutpatient PFTs\n- patient needs electrolyte check at her PCP appointment on \n___\n- diltiazem extended release 180 mg daily was restarted on \ndischarge due to resolution of her cardiomyopathy\n- patient kept on furosemide 20 mg daily as she most likely has \nsome diastolic heart failure\n- discharge weight: 55 kg\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
